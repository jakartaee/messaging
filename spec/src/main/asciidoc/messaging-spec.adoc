== Introduction

This specification describes the objectives and functionality of the
Jakarta Messaging.

Jakarta Messaging provides a common way for Java programs to create, send, receive and
read an enterprise messaging system’s messages.

=== Overview of Jakarta Messaging

Enterprise messaging products (or as they are sometimes called,
message-oriented middleware products) are an essential component for
integrating intra-company operations. They allow separate business
components to be combined into a reliable, yet flexible, system.

Jakarta Messaging was initially developed to provide a standard Java API for the
established messaging products that already existed. Since then many
more messaging products have been developed.

Jakarta Messaging provides a common way for both Java client applications and Java
middle-tier services to use these messaging products. It defines some
messaging semantics and a corresponding set of Java interfaces.

Since messaging is a peer-to-peer technology, users of Jakarta Messaging are referred
to generically as _clients_. A Jakarta Messaging _application_ is made up of a set of
application defined messages and a set of clients that exchange them.

Messaging products that implement Jakarta Messaging do so by supplying a _provider_
that implements the Jakarta Messaging interfaces. Messaging products may support
clients which use programming languages other than Java. Although such
support is beyond the scope of Jakarta Messaging, the design of Jakarta Messaging has always
accommodated the need for messaging products to support languages other
than Java.

==== What is messaging?

The term _messaging_ is quite broadly defined in computing. It is used
for describing various operating system concepts; it is used to describe
email and fax systems; and here, it is used to describe asynchronous
communication between enterprise applications.

Messages, as described here, are asynchronous requests, reports or
events that are consumed by enterprise applications, not humans. They
contain vital information needed to coordinate these systems. They
contain precisely formatted data that describe specific business
actions. Through the exchange of these messages each application tracks
the progress of the enterprise.

==== The objectives of Jakarta Messaging

The objectives of Jakarta Messaging are

* to provide Java applications with the messaging functionality needed
to implement sophisticated enterprise applications
* to define a common set of messaging concepts and facilities
* to minimize the concepts a Java language programmer must learn to use
enterprise messaging products
* to maximize the portability of Java messaging applications between
different messaging products

==== Jakarta Messaging domains

Jakarta Messaging supports the two major styles of messaging provided by enterprise
messaging products:

* Point-to-point (PTP) messaging allows a client to send a message to
another client via an intermediate abstraction called a _queue_. The
client that sends the message sends it to a specific queue. The client
that receives the message extracts it from that queue.
* Publish and subscribe (pub/sub) messaging allows a client to send a
message to multiple clients via an intermediate abstraction called a
_topic_. The client that sends the message _publishes_ it to a specific
topic. The message is then delivered to all the clients that are
_subscribed_ to that topic.

==== What Jakarta Messaging does not include

Jakarta Messaging does not address the following functionality:

* Load balancing/fault tolerance - Many products provide support for
multiple, cooperating clients implementing a critical service. The Jakarta Messaging
API does not specify how such clients cooperate to appear to be a
single, unified service.
* Error/advisory notification - Most messaging products define system
messages that provide asynchronous notification of problems or system
events to clients. Jakarta Messaging does not attempt to standardize these messages.
By following the guidelines defined by Jakarta Messaging, clients can avoid using
these messages and thus prevent the portability problems their use
introduces.
* Administration - Jakarta Messaging does not define an API for administering
messaging products.
* Security - Jakarta Messaging does not specify an API for controlling the privacy and
integrity of messages. It also does not specify how digital signatures
or keys are distributed to clients. Security is considered to be a Jakarta Messaging
provider-specific feature that is configured by an administrator rather
than controlled via the Jakarta Messaging API by clients.
* Wire protocol - Jakarta Messaging does not define a wire protocol for messaging.
* Message type repository - Jakarta Messaging does not define a repository for storing
message type definitions and it does not define a language for creating
message type definitions.

==== Java SE and Jakarta EE support

The Jakarta Messaging API is designed to be suitable for use by both Java client
applications using the Java™ Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE), and
Java middle-tier services using Jakarta EE.

A Jakarta Messaging provider must support its use by Java client applications using
Java SE. It is optional whether a given Jakarta Messaging provider supports its use by
middle-tier applications using Jakarta EE.

The Jakarta EE Specification requires a full Jakarta EE platform
implementation to include a messaging provider which supports the Jakarta Messaging
API in both Java SE and Jakarta EE applications.

Jakarta EE makes a number of additional features available to messaging
applications beyond those defined in the Jakarta Messaging specification itself, most
notably message-driven beans (MDBs) and Jakarta transactions. Jakarta EE also
imposes a number of restrictions on the use of the Jakarta Messaging API.

For more information on the use of Jakarta Messaging by Jakarta EE applications, see
chapter 12 “Use of Jakarta Messaging API in Jakarta EE applications”.

=== What is new in Jakarta Messaging 2.0?

A full list of the new features, changes and clarifications introduced
in Jakarta Messaging 2.0 is given in section A.1 “Version 2.0” of the “Change history”
chapter. Here is a summary:

The Jakarta Messaging 2.0 specification now requires Jakarta Messaging providers to implement both
PTP and pub/sub.

The following new messaging features have been added in Jakarta Messaging 2.0:

* Delivery delay: a message producer can now specify that a message must
not be delivered until after a specified time interval.
* New send methods have been added to allow an application to send
messages asynchronously.
* Jakarta Messaging providers must now set the JMSXDeliveryCount message property.
+
The following change has been made to aid scalability:
* Applications which create a durable or non-durable topic subscription
may now designate them to be “shared”. A shared subscription may have
multiple consumers.
+
Several changes have been made to the Jakarta Messaging API to make it simpler and
easier to use:
* Connection, Session and other objects with a close() method now
implement the java.lang.AutoCloseable interface to allow them to be used
in a Java SE 7 try-with-resources statement.
* A new “simplified API” has been added which offers a simpler
alternative to the previous API, especially in Jakarta EE applications.
* New methods have been added to create a session without the need to
supply redundant arguments.
* Although setting client ID remains mandatory when creating an unshared
durable subscription, it is optional when creating a shared durable
subscription.
* A new method getBody has been added to allow an application to extract
the body directly from a Message without the need to cast it first to an
appropriate subtype.
+
A new chapter has been added which describes some additional
restrictions and behaviour which apply when using the Jakarta Messaging API in the
Jakarta EE web container or the Enterprise Beans container. This information was previously only
available in the Jakarta Enterprise Beans and Jakarta EE platform specifications.
+
A new chapter has been added which adds a new recommendation for a Jakarta Messaging
provider to include a resource adapter, and which defines a number of
activation configuration properties.
+
New methods have been added to Session which return a MessageConsumer on
a durable topic subscription. Applications could previously only obtain
a domain-specific TopicSubscriber, even though its use was discouraged.
+
The specification has been clarified in various places.

== Architecture

=== Overview

This chapter describes the environment of message based applications and
the role Jakarta Messaging plays in this environment.

=== What is a Jakarta Messaging application?

A Jakarta Messaging application is composed of the following parts:

* Jakarta Messaging Clients - These are the Java language programs that send and
receive messages.
* Non-Jakarta Messaging Clients - These are clients that use a message system’s native
client API instead of Jakarta Messaging. If the application predated the availability
of Jakarta Messaging it is likely that it will include both Jakarta Messaging and non-Jakarta Messaging clients.
* Messages - Each application defines a set of messages that are used to
communicate information between its clients.
* Jakarta Messaging Provider - This is a messaging system that implements Jakarta Messaging in
addition to the other administrative and control functionality required
of a full featured messaging product.
* Administered Objects - Administered objects are preconfigured Jakarta Messaging
objects created by an administrator for the use of clients.

=== Administration

It is expected that each Jakarta Messaging provider will differ significantly in its
underlying messaging technology. It is also expected there will be major
differences in how a provider’s system is installed and administered.

If Jakarta Messaging clients are to be portable, they must be isolated from these
proprietary aspects of a provider. This is done by defining Jakarta Messaging
administered objects that are created and customized by a provider’s
administrator and later used by clients. The client uses them through
Jakarta Messaging interfaces that are portable. The administrator creates them using
provider-specific facilities.

There are two types of Jakarta Messaging administered objects:

* ConnectionFactory - This is the object a client uses to create a
connection with a provider.
* Destination - This is the object a client uses to specify the
destination of messages it is sending and the source of messages it
receives.

Administered objects are placed in a JNDI namespace by an administrator.
A Jakarta Messaging client typically notes in its documentation the Jakarta Messaging administered
objects it requires and how the JNDI names of these objects should be
provided to it. Figure 2‑1 illustrates how Jakarta Messaging administration ordinarily
works.

Figure 2‑1 Jakarta Messaging Administration

image:1.png[image,width=390,height=213]

=== Two messaging styles

A Jakarta Messaging application can use either the point-to-point (PTP) or the
publish-and-subscribe (pub/sub) style of messaging, which are described
in more detail later in this specification. An application can also
combine both styles of messaging in one application. These two styles of
messaging are often referred to as messaging domains. Jakarta Messaging provides these
two messaging domains because they represent two common models for
messaging.

When using the Jakarta Messaging API, a developer can use interfaces and methods that
support both models of messaging. When using these interfaces, the
behavior of the messaging system may be somewhat different, because the
two messaging domains have different semantics. These semantic
differences are described in chapter 4 “Messaging domains”.

=== Jakarta Messaging APIs

For historical reasons Jakarta Messaging offers four alternative sets of interfaces
for sending and receiving messages.

JMS 1.0 defined two *domain-specific APIs*, one for point-to-point
messaging (queues) and one for pub/sub (topics). Although these remain
part of Jakarta Messaging for reasons of backwards compatibility they should be
considered to be completely superseded by the later APIs.

JMS 1.1 introduced a new unified API which offered a single set of
interfaces that could be used for both point-to-point and pub/sub
messaging. This is referred to here as the *classic API*.

JMS 2.0 introduces a *simplified API* which offers all the features of
the classic API but which requires fewer interfaces and is simpler to
use.

Each API offers a different set of interfaces for connecting to a Jakarta Messaging
provider and for sending and receiving messages. However they all share
a common set of interfaces for representing messages and message
destinations and to provide various utility features.

All interfaces are in the jakarta.jms package.

=== Interfaces common to multiple APIs

The main interfaces common to multiple APIs are as follows:

* Message, BytesMessage, MapMessage, ObjectMessage, StreamMessage and
TextMessage – a message sent to or received from a Jakarta Messaging provider.
* Queue – an administered object that encapsulates the identity of a
message destination for point-to-point messaging
* Topic – an administered object that encapsulates the identity of a
message destination for pub/sub messaging.
* Destination - the common supertype of Queue and Topic

=== Classic API interfaces

The main interfaces provided by the classic API are as follows:

* ConnectionFactory - an administered object used by a client to create
a Connection. This interface is also used by the simplified API.
* Connection - an active connection to a Jakarta Messaging provider
* Session - a single-threaded context for sending and receiving messages
* MessageProducer - an object created by a Session that is used for
sending messages to a queue or topic
* MessageConsumer - an object created by a Session that is used for
receiving messages sent to a queue or topic

Figure 2‑2 Overview of classic API
image:2.png[image]

=== Simplified API interfaces

The simplified API provides the same messaging functionality as the
classic API but requires fewer interfaces and is simpler to use.

The main interfaces provided by the simplified API are as follows:

* ConnectionFactory - an administered object used by a client to create
a Connection. This interface is also used by the classic API.
* JMSContext - an active connection to a Jakarta Messaging provider and a
single-threaded context for sending and receiving messages
* JMSProducer - an object created by a JMSContext that is used for
sending messages to a queue or topic
* JMSConsumer - an object created by a JMSContext that is used for
receiving messages sent to a queue or topic

Figure 2‑3 Overview of simplified API
image:3.png[image]

In the simplified API a single JMSContext object encompasses the
behaviour which in the classic API is provided by two separate objects,
a Connection and a Session. Although this specification refers to the
JMSContext as having an underlying “connection” and “session”, the
simplified API does not use the Connection and Session interfaces.

==== Goals of the simplified API

The simplified API has the following goals:

* To reduce the number of objects needed to send and receive messages,
and in particular to combine the Jakarta Messaging Connection, Session objects into a
single object.
* To maintain a consistent style with the existing API where possible so
that users of the old API feel it to be an evolution which they can
learn quickly. In particular the simplified API will continue to use the
concepts of connection and session even though it doesn’t require the
use of Connection or Session objects.
* To be capable of use in both Jakarta EE and Java SE applications.
* To allow resource injection to be exploited in those environments
which support it.
* To provide the option to send and receive the message body directly
without the need to use jakarta.jms.Message objects.
* To remove where possible the need to catch JMSException on method
calls
* To be functionally as complete as the classic API, so that users of
the simplified API will not have the need to switch back to the classic
API in order to perform an operation that is unavailable in the
simplified API.
* To be an alternative to, but not a replacement for, the classic API.
The classic API remains and is not deprecated. Developers who are
familiar with the classic API, or who prefer it, may continue to use the
classic API.

==== Key features of the simplified API

The main object in the simplified API is jakarta.jms.JMSContext. This
combines in a single object the functionality of several separate
objects from the classic API. In particular it combines the
functionality of a Connection and a Session in a single object.

Although the JMSContext does not expose constituent Connection and
Session objects to applications, the concepts of connection and session
remain important. A Connection represents a physical link to the Jakarta Messaging
server, a Session represents a single-threaded context for sending and
receiving messages, and a JMSContext represents both.

Applications that send messages will use the JMSContext method
createProducer to create a jakarta.jms.JMSProducer object. This provides
an API to send messages. Although it provides similar functionality to
an anonymous MessageProducer (one with no destination specified) it
provides a more convenient API for configuring delivery options, message
properties and message headers.

Applications that consume messages will use one of several methods on
JMSContext to create a jakarta.jms.JMSConsumer object. This provides a
similar API to a MessageConsumer for consuming messages from a
particular queue or topic. Messages may be consumed either synchronously
or asynchronously, except in a Jakarta EE web containers or Enterprise Beans container where
messages may be consumed only synchronously.

Applications running in the Jakarta EE web containers and Enterprise Beans containers must not
create more than one active session on a connection (see Section 12.2
“Restrictions on the use of Jakarta Messaging API in the Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container”. Since a JMSContext contains a single connection and a single
session it is ideally suited for use by such applications.

Applications running in a Java SE environment or in the Jakarta EE
application client container are permitted to create multiple active
sessions on the same connection. This allows the same physical
connection to be used in multiple threads simultaneously. Such
applications which require multiple sessions to be created on the same
connection should use the factory methods on the ConnectionFactory
interface to create the first JMSContext and then use the createContext
method on JMSContext to create additional JMSContext objects that use
the same connection:

To simplify application code, methods on JMSContext throw unchecked
exceptions rather than checked exceptions.

=== Legacy domain-specific API interfaces

Although the domain-specific API remains part of Jakarta Messaging for reasons of
backwards compatibility it should be considered to be completely
superseded by the classic and simplified APIs.

The main interfaces provided by the domain-specific API for
*point-to-point* messaging are as follows:

* QueueConnectionFactory - an administered object used by a client to
create a QueueConnection.
* QueueConnection - an active connection to a Jakarta Messaging provider
* QueueSession - a single-threaded context for sending and receiving
messages
* QueueSender - an object created by a QueueSession that is used for
sending messages to a queue
* QueueReceiver - an object created by a QueueSession that is used for
receiving messages sent to a queue
+

image:4.png[image]

The main interfaces provided by the domain-specific API for *pub/sub*
messaging are as follows:

* TopicConnectionFactory - an administered object used by a client to
create a TopicConnection.
* TopicConnection - an active connection to a Jakarta Messaging provider
* TopicSession - a single-threaded context for sending and receiving
messages
* TopicPublisher - an object created by a TopicSession that is used for
sending messages to a topic
* TopicSubscriber - an object created by a TopicSession that is used for
receiving messages sent to a topic

APIs and how they correspond to one another:

=== Terminology for sending and receiving messages

The term _consume_ is used in this document to mean the receipt of a
message by a Jakarta Messaging client; that is, a Jakarta Messaging provider has received a message
and has given it to its client. Since Jakarta Messaging supports both synchronous and
asynchronous receipt of messages, the term _consume_ is used when there
is no need to make a distinction between them.

The term _produce_ is used as the most general term for sending a
message. It means giving a message to a Jakarta Messaging provider for delivery to a
destination.

=== Developing a Jakarta Messaging application

Broadly speaking, a Jakarta Messaging application is one or more Jakarta Messaging clients that
exchange messages. The application may also involve non-Jakarta Messaging clients;
however, these clients use the Jakarta Messaging provider’s native API in place of
JMS.

A Jakarta Messaging application can be architected and deployed as a unit. In many
cases, Jakarta Messaging clients are added incrementally to an existing application.

The message definitions used by an application may originate with Jakarta Messaging or
they may have been defined by the non-Jakarta Messaging part of the application.

==== Developing a Jakarta Messaging client

A typical Jakarta Messaging client using the classic API executes the following Jakarta Messaging
setup procedure:

* Use JNDI to find a ConnectionFactory object
* Use JNDI to find one or more Destination objects
* Use the ConnectionFactory to create a Jakarta Messaging Connection object with
message delivery inhibited
* Use the Connection to create one or more Jakarta Messaging Session objects
* Use a Session and the Destinations to create the MessageProducer and
MessageConsumer objects needed
* Tell the Connection to start delivery of messages

In contrast, a typical Jakarta Messaging client using the simplified API does the
following:

* Use JNDI to find a ConnectionFactory object
* Use JNDI to find one or more Destination objects
* Use the ConnectionFactory to create a JMSContext object
* Use the JMSContext to create the JMSProducer and JMSConsumer objects
needed.
* Delivery of messages is started automatically

At this point a client has the basic Jakarta Messaging setup needed to produce and
consume messages.

=== Security

Jakarta Messaging does not provide features for controlling or configuring message
integrity or message privacy.

It is expected that many Jakarta Messaging providers will provide such features. It is
also expected that configuration of these services will be handled by
provider-specific administration tools. Clients will get the proper
security configuration as part of the administered objects they use.

=== Multi-threading

Jakarta Messaging could have required that all its objects support concurrent use.
Since support for concurrent access typically adds some overhead and
complexity, the Jakarta Messaging design restricts its requirement for concurrent
access to those objects that would naturally be shared by a
multi-threaded client. The remaining objects are designed to be accessed
by one logical thread of control at a time.

concurrent use

|===

Jakarta Messaging defines some specific rules that restrict the concurrent use of
sessions. These apply to the Session object in the classic API and to
the QueueSession and TopicSession objects in the domain-specific APIs.
They also apply to the JMSContext object in the simplified API since it
encompasses a session. Since these rules require more knowledge of Jakarta Messaging
specifics than we have presented at this point, they will be described
later. Here we will describe the rationale for imposing them.

There are two reasons for restricting concurrent access to sessions.
First, sessions are the Jakarta Messaging entity that supports transactions. It is
very difficult to implement transactions that are multi-threaded.
Second, sessions support asynchronous message consumption. It is
important that Jakarta Messaging _not_ require that client code used for asynchronous
message consumption be capable of handling multiple, concurrent
messages. In addition, if a session has been set up with multiple,
asynchronous consumers, it is important that the client is not forced to
handle the case where these separate consumers are concurrently
executing. These restrictions make Jakarta Messaging easier to use for typical
clients. More sophisticated clients can get the concurrency they desire
by using multiple sessions. In the classic API and the domain-specific
APIs this means using multiple session objects. In the simplified API
this means using multiple JMSContext objects.

=== Triggering clients

Some clients are designed to periodically wake up and process messages
waiting for them. A message-based application triggering mechanism is
often used with this style of client. The trigger is typically a
threshold of waiting messages, etc.

Jakarta Messaging does not provide a mechanism for triggering the execution of a
client. Some providers may supply such a triggering mechanism via their
administrative facilities.

=== Request/reply

Jakarta Messaging provides the JMSReplyTo message header field for specifying the
Destination where a reply to a message should be sent. The
JMSCorrelationID header field of the reply can be used to reference the
original request. See Section 3.4 “Message header fields” for more information.

In addition, Jakarta Messaging provides a facility for creating temporary queues and
topics that can be used as a unique destination for replies.

Enterprise messaging products support many styles of request/reply, from
the simple “one message request yields one message reply” to “one
message request yields streams of messages from multiple respondents.”
Rather than architect a specific Jakarta Messaging request/reply abstraction, Jakarta Messaging
provides the basic facilities on which many can be built.

The legacy domain-specific APIs define request/reply helper classes
(classes written using Jakarta Messaging) for both the point-to-point and pub/sub
domains that implement a basic form of request/reply. See sections 4.1.7
“QueueRequestor” and 4.2.10 “TopicRequestor”. Jakarta Messaging providers and clients may provide more specialized
implementations.

== Jakarta Messaging message model

=== Background

Enterprise messaging products treat messages as lightweight entities
that consist of a header and a body. The header contains fields used for
message routing and identification; the body contains the application
data being sent.

Within this general form, the definition of a message varies
significantly across products. There are major differences in the
content and semantics of headers. Some products use a self describing,
canonical encoding of message data; others treat data as completely
opaque. Some products provide a repository for storing message
descriptions that can be used to identify and interpret message content;
others don’t.

It would be quite difficult for Jakarta Messaging to capture the breadth of this,
sometimes conflicting, union of message models.

=== Goals

The Jakarta Messaging message model has the following goals:

* Provide a single, unified message API
* Provide an API suitable for creating messages that match the format
used by existing, non-Jakarta Messaging applications
* Support the development of heterogeneous applications that span
operating systems, machine architectures, and computer languages
* Support messages containing Java objects
* Support messages containing Extensible Markup Language pages (see
http://www.w3.org/XML).

=== Jakarta Messaging messages

Jakarta Messaging messages are composed of the following parts:

* Header - All messages support the same set of header fields. Header
fields contain values used by both clients and providers to identify and
route messages.
* Properties - In addition to the standard header fields, messages
provide a built-in facility for adding optional header fields to a
message.
** Application-specific properties - In effect, this provides a
mechanism for adding application specific header fields to a message.
** Standard properties - Jakarta Messaging defines some standard properties that are,
in effect, optional header fields.
** Provider-specific properties – Some Jakarta Messaging providers may require the use
of provider-specific properties. Jakarta Messaging defines a naming convention for
these.
* Body - Jakarta Messaging defines several types of message body which cover the
majority of messaging styles currently in use.

=== Message header fields

The following subsections describe each Jakarta Messaging message header field. A
message’s complete header is transmitted to all Jakarta Messaging clients that receive
the message. Jakarta Messaging does not define the header fields transmitted to
non-Jakarta Messaging clients.

==== JMSDestination

The JMSDestination header field contains the destination to which the
message is being sent.

When a message is sent this value is ignored. After completion of the
send it holds the Destination object specified by the sending method.

When a message is received, its destination value must be equivalent to
the value assigned when it was sent.

==== JMSDeliveryMode

The JMSDeliveryMode header field contains the delivery mode specified
when the message was sent.

When a message is sent this value is ignored. After completion of the
send, it holds the delivery mode specified by the sending method.

See Section 7.7 “Message delivery mode” for more information.

==== JMSMessageID

The JMSMessageID header field contains a value that uniquely identifies
each message sent by a provider.

When a message is sent, JMSMessageID is ignored. When the send method
returns it contains a provider-assigned value.

A JMSMessageID is a String value which should function as a unique key
for identifying messages in a historical repository. The exact scope of
uniqueness is provider defined. It should at least cover all messages
for a specific installation of a provider where an installation is some
connected set of message routers.

All JMSMessageID values must start with the prefix 'ID:'. Uniqueness of
message ID values across different providers is not required.

Since message IDs take some effort to create and increase a message’s
size, some Jakarta Messaging providers may be able to optimize message overhead if
they are given a hint that message ID is not used by an application.
Both MessageProducer and JMSProducer provide a method
setDisableMessageID which allows the application to provide a hint to
disable message ID. When an application sets a producer to disable
message ID, it is saying that it does not depend on the value of message
ID for the messages it produces. If the Jakarta Messaging provider accepts this hint,
these messages must have the message ID set to null; if the provider
ignores the hint, the message ID must be set to its normal unique value.

==== JMSTimestamp

The JMSTimestamp header field contains the time a message was handed off
to a provider to be sent. It is not the time the message was actually
transmitted because the actual send may occur later due to transactions
or other client side queueing of messages.

When a message is sent, JMSTimestamp is ignored. When the send method
returns, the field contains a time value somewhere in the interval
between the call and the return. It is in the format of a normal Java
millis time value.

Since timestamps take some effort to create and increase a message’s
size, some Jakarta Messaging providers may be able to optimize message overhead if
they are given a hint that timestamp is not used by an application. Both
MessageProducer and JMSProducer provide a method
setDisableMessageTimestamp which allows the application to provide a
hint to disable timestamps. When an application sets a producer to
disable timestamps it is saying that it does not depend on the value of
timestamp for the messages it produces. If the Jakarta Messaging provider accepts this
hint, these messages must have the timestamp set to zero; if the
provider ignores the hint, the timestamp must be set to its normal
value.

==== JMSCorrelationID

A client can use the JMSCorrelationID header field to link one message
with another. A typical use is to link a response message with its
request message.

JMSCorrelationID can hold one of the following:

* A provider-specific message ID
* An application-specific String
* A provider-native byte[] value.

Since each message sent by a Jakarta Messaging provider is assigned a message ID value
it is convenient to link messages via message ID. All message ID values
must start with the 'ID:' prefix.

In some cases, an application (made up of several clients) needs to use
an application-specific value for linking messages. For instance, an
application may use JMSCorrelationID to hold a value referencing some
external information. Application-specified values must not start with
the 'ID:' prefix; this is reserved for provider-generated message ID
values.

If a provider supports the native concept of correlation ID, a Jakarta Messaging
client may need to assign specific JMSCorrelationID values to match
those expected by non-Jakarta Messaging clients. A byte[] value is used for this
purpose. Jakarta Messaging providers without native correlation ID values are not
required to support byte[] valuesfootnote:[Their implementation of
setJMSCorrelationIDAsBytes() and getJMSCorrelationIDAsBytes() may throw
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException.] The use of a byte[] value for
JMSCorrelationID is non-portable.

==== JMSReplyTo

The JMSReplyTo header field contains a Destination supplied by a client
when a message is sent. It is the destination where a reply to the
message should be sent.

Messages sent with a null JMSReplyTo value may be a notification of some
event or they may just be some data the sender thinks is of interest.

Messages sent with a JMSReplyTo value are typically expecting a
response. A response may be optional; it is up to the client to decide.

==== JMSRedelivered

If a client receives a message with the JMSRedelivered indicator set, it
is likely, but not guaranteed, that this message was delivered but not
acknowledged in the past. In general, a provider must set the
JMSRedelivered message header field of a message whenever it is
redelivering a message. If the field is set to true, it is an indication
to the consuming application that the message may have been delivered in
the past and that the application should take extra precautions to
prevent duplicate processing. See Section 6.2.10 “Message
acknowledgment” for more information.

This header field has no meaning on send and is left unassigned by the
sending method.

The Jakarta Messaging-defined message property JMSXDeliveryCount will be set to the
number of times a particular message has been delivered. See section
3.5.11 “JMSXDeliveryCount” for more information.

==== JMSType

The JMSType header field contains a message type identifier supplied by
a client when a message is sent.

Some Jakarta Messaging providers use a message repository that contains the
definitions of messages sent by applications. The JMSType header field
may reference a message’s definition in the provider’s repository.

Jakarta Messaging does not define a standard message definition repository nor does it
define a naming policy for the definitions it contains.

Some messaging systems require that a message type definition for each
application message be created and that each message specify its type.
In order to work with such Jakarta Messaging providers, Jakarta Messaging clients should assign a
value to JMSType whether the application makes use of it or not. This
ensures that the field is properly set for those providers that require
it.

To ensure portability, Jakarta Messaging clients should use symbolic values for
JMSType that can be configured at installation time to the values
defined in the current provider’s message repository. If string literals
are used they may not be valid type names for some Jakarta Messaging providers.

==== JMSExpiration

When a message is sent, the Jakarta Messaging provider calculates its expiration time
by adding the time-to-live value specified on the send method to the
time the message was sent (for transacted sends, this is the time the
client sends the message, not the time the transaction is committed). It
is represented as a long value which is defined as the difference,
measured in milliseconds, between the expiration time and midnight,
January 1, 1970 UTC.

On return from the send method, the message’s JMSExpiration header field
contains this value. When a message is received its JMSExpiration header
field contains this same value.

If the time-to-live is specified as zero, the message’s JMSExpiration
header field is set to zero to indicate that the message does not
expire.

When an undelivered message’s expiration time is reached, the message
should be destroyed. Jakarta Messaging does not define a notification of message
expiration.

Clients should not receive messages that have expired; however, Jakarta Messaging does
not guarantee that this will not happen.

==== JMSPriority

The JMSPriority header field contains the message’s priority.

When a message is sent this value is ignored. After completion of the
send it holds the value specified by the method sending the message.

Jakarta Messaging defines a ten level priority value with 0 as the lowest priority and
9 as the highest. In addition, clients should consider priorities 0-4 as
gradations of _normal_ priority and priorities 5-9 as gradations of
_expedited_ priority.

Jakarta Messaging does not require that a provider strictly implement priority
ordering of messages; however, it should do its best to deliver
expedited messages ahead of normal messages.

==== How message header values are set

The following table lists the message header fields supported by Jakarta Messaging and
whether they are set by the Jakarta Messaging provider or by the client application.

Table 3‑1 Message header field values

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Header Fields |Set By |Setter method
|JMSDestination |Jakarta Messaging provider send method |setJMSDestination +

(not for client use)

|===

Message header fields that are defined as being set by the “client
application” in the above table may be set by the client application,
using the appropriate setter method, before the message is sent.

Message header fields that are defined as being set by the “Jakarta Messaging provider
send method” will be available on the sending client as well as on the
receiving client. If a message is sent synchronously (see section 7.2
“Synchronous send”) then these message header fields may be accessed on
the sending client when the send method returns. If a message is sent
asynchronously (see section 7.3 “Asynchronous send”) then these message
header fields may be accessed on the sending client only after the
completion listener has been invoked. The Jakarta Messaging provider sets these header
fields using the appropriate setter methods. These setter methods are
public to allow a Jakarta Messaging provider to set these fields when handling a
message whose implementation is not its own. Client applications should
not use these setter methods. Any values set by calling these methods
prior to sending a message will be ignored and overwritten.

A client application may specify the delivery mode, priority, time to
live and delivery delay of a message using appropriate methods on the
MessageProducer or JMSProducer object, but not by methods on the Message
object itself.

Message header fields that are defined as being set by the “Jakarta Messaging provider
prior to delivery” will be set by the Jakarta Messaging provider on the message
delivered to the receiving client.

==== Overriding message header fields

Jakarta Messaging permits an administrator to configure Jakarta Messaging to override the client
specified values for delivery mode, priority, time to live and delivery
delay. If this is done, the JMSDeliveryMode, JMSPriority, JMSExpiration
and JMSDeliveryTime header field value must reflect the administratively
specified value.

Jakarta Messaging does not define specifically how an administrator overrides these
header field values. A Jakarta Messaging provider is not required to support this
administrative option.

==== JMSDeliveryTime

When a message is sent, the Jakarta Messaging provider calculates its delivery time by
adding the delivery delay value specified on the send method to the time
the message was sent (for transacted sends, this is the time the client
sends the message, not the time the transaction is committed). It is
represented as a long value which is defined as the difference, measured
in milliseconds, between the delivery time time and midnight, January 1,
1970 UTC.

On return from the send method, the message’s JMSDeliveryTime header
field contains this value. When a message is received its
JMSDeliveryTime header field contains this same value.

A message's delivery time is the earliest time when a provider may make
the message visible on the target destination and available for delivery
to consumers.

Clients must not receive messages before the delivery time has been
reached.

=== Message properties 

In addition to the header fields defined here, the Message interface
contains a built-in facility for supporting property values. In effect,
this provides a mechanism for adding optional header fields to a
message.

Properties allow a client, via message selectors (see Section 3.8
“Message selection”), to have a Jakarta Messaging provider select messages on its
behalf using application-specific criteria.

==== Property names

Property names must obey the rules for a message selector identifier.
See Section 3.8 “Message selection” for more information.

==== Property values

Property values can be boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double,
and String.

==== Using properties

Property values are set prior to sending a message. When a client
receives a message, its properties are in read-only mode. If a client
attempts to set properties at this point, a MessageNotWriteableException
is thrown.

A property value may duplicate a value in a message’s body or it may
not. Although Jakarta Messaging does not define a policy for what should or should not
be made a property, application developers should note that Jakarta Messaging
providers will likely handle data in a message’s body more efficiently
than data in a message’s properties. For best performance, applications
should only use message properties when they need to customize a
message’s header. The primary reason for doing this is to support
customized message selection.

See Section 3.8 “Message selection” for more information about Jakarta Messaging
message properties.

==== Property value conversion

Properties support the following conversion table. The marked cases must
be supported. The unmarked cases must throw the Jakarta Messaging
MessageFormatException. The String to numeric conversions must throw the
java.lang.NumberFormatException if the numeric’s valueOf method does not
accept the String value as a valid representation. Attempting to read a
null value as a Java primitive type must be treated as calling the
primitive’s corresponding valueOf(String) conversion method with a null
value.

A value set as the row type can be read as the column type.

Table 3‑2 Property value conversion

[cols=",,,,,,,,",options="header",]
|===
| |boolean |byte |short |int |long |float |double |String
|boolean |X | | | | | | |X
|byte | |X |X |X |X | | |X
|short | | |X |X |X | | |X
|int | | | |X |X | | |X
|long | | | | |X | | |X
|float | | | | | |X |X |X
|double | | | | | | |X |X
|String |X |X |X |X |X |X |X |X
|===

==== Property values as objects

In addition to the type-specific set/get methods for properties, Jakarta Messaging
provides the setObjectProperty/getObjectProperty methods. These support
the same set of property types using the objectified primitive values.
Their purpose is to allow the decision of property type to be made at
execution time rather than at compile time. They support the same
property value conversions.

The setObjectProperty method accepts values of Boolean, Byte, Short,
Integer, Long, Float, Double and String. An attempt to use any other
class must throw a Jakarta Messaging MessageFormatException.

The getObjectProperty method only returns values of null, Boolean, Byte,
Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double and String. A null value is returned
if a property by the specified name does not exist.

==== Property iteration

The order of property values is not defined. To iterate through a
message’s property values, use getPropertyNames to retrieve a property
name enumeration and then use the various property get methods to
retrieve their values.

The getPropertyNames method does not return the names of the Jakarta Messaging
standard header fields.

==== Clearing a message’s property values

A message’s properties are deleted by the clearProperties method. This
leaves the message with an empty set of properties. New property entries
can then be both created and read.

Clearing a message’s property entries does not clear the value of its
body.

Jakarta Messaging does not provide a way to remove an individual property entry once
it has been added to a message.

==== Non-existent properties

Getting a property value for a name which has not been set is handled as
if the property exists with a null value.

==== Jakarta Messaging defined properties

Jakarta Messaging reserves the 'JMSX' property name prefix for Jakarta Messaging defined properties.
The full set of these properties is provided in Table 3‑3. This table
defines:

* The name of the property
* The type of the property (integer or string)
* Whether support for the property is mandatory or optional.
* Whether the property is set by the sending client, by the provider
when the message is sent, or by the provider when the message is
received.
* The purpose of the property

Table 3‑3 Jakarta Messaging defined properties

[cols=",,,,",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Type |Optional or mandatory |Set By |Use
|JMSXUserID |String |Optional |Provider on Send |The identity of the
user sending the message

|JMSXAppID |String |Optional |Provider on Send |The identity of the
application sending the message

|JMSXDeliveryCount |int |Mandatory |Provider on Receive |The number of
message delivery attempts. See section 3.5.11
“JMSXDeliveryCount”.

|JMSXGroupID |String |Optional |Client |The identity of the message
group this message is part of

|JMSXGroupSeq |int |Optional |Client |The sequence number of this
message within the group; the first message is 1, the second 2,...

|JMSXProducerTXID |String |Optional |Provider on Send |The transaction
identifier of the transaction within which this message was produced

|JMSXConsumerTXID |String |Optional |Provider on Receive |The
transaction identifier of the transaction within which this message was
consumed

|JMSXRcvTimestamp |long |Optional |Provider on Receive |The time Jakarta Messaging
delivered the message to the consumer

|JMSXState |int |Optional |Provider a|
Assume there exists a message warehouse that contains a separate copy of
each message sent to each consumer and that these copies exist from the
time the original message was sent.

Each copy’s state is one of: 1(waiting), 2(ready), 3(expired) or
4(retained)

Since state is of no interest to producers and consumers it is not
provided to either. It is only of relevance to messages looked up in a
warehouse and Jakarta Messaging provides no API for this.

|===

New Jakarta Messaging defined properties may be added in later versions of Jakarta Messaging.

The Enumeration ConnectionMetaData.getJMSXPropertyNames() method returns
the names of the JMSX properties supported by a connection.

JMSX properties may be referenced in message selectors whether or not
they are supported by a connection. If they are not present in a
message, they are treated like any other absent property. The effect of
setting a message selector on a property which is set by the provider on
receive is undefined.

The existence, in a particular message, of optional Jakarta Messaging defined
properties that are set by a Jakarta Messaging Provider depends on how a particular
provider controls use of the property. It may choose to include them in
some messages and omit them in others depending on administrative or
other criteria.

JMSX properties ‘set by provider on send’ are available to both the
producer and the consumers of the message. JSMX properties set by the
provider on receive are only available to the consumers. JMSXGroupID and
JMSXGroupSeq are standard properties clients should use if they want to
group messages. All providers must support them.

The case of these JMSX property names must be as defined in the table
above.

Unless specifically noted, the values and semantics of the JMSX
properties are undefined.

==== Provider-specific properties

Jakarta Messaging reserves the ‘JMS_<vendor_name>’ property name prefix for
provider-specific properties. Each provider defines their own value of
__<vendor_name>__. This is the mechanism a Jakarta Messaging provider uses to make its
special per message services available to a Jakarta Messaging client.

_The purpose of provider-specific properties is to provide special
features needed to support Jakarta Messaging use with provider-native clients. They
should not be used for Jakarta Messaging to Jakarta Messaging messaging._

==== JMSXDeliveryCount

When a client receives a message the mandatory Jakarta Messaging-defined message
property JMSXDeliveryCount will be set to the number of times the
message has been delivered. The first time a message is received it will
be set to 1, so a value of 2 or more means the message has been
redelivered.

If the JMSRedelivered message header value is set then the
JMSXDeliveryCount property must always be 2 or more. See section 3.4.7
“JMSRedelivered” for more information about the JMSRedelivered message
header,

The purpose of the JMSXDeliveryCount property is to allow consuming
applications to identify whether a particular message is being
repeatedly redelivered and take appropriate action.

The value of the JMSXDeliveryCount property is not guaranteed to be
exactly correct. The Jakarta Messaging provider is not expected to persist this value
to ensure that its value is not lost in the event of a failure.

=== Message acknowledgment

All Jakarta Messaging messages support the acknowledge method for use when a client
has specified that a Jakarta Messaging consumer’s messages are to be explicitly
acknowledged.

If a client uses automatic acknowledgment, calls to acknowledge are
ignored.

See Section 6.2.10 “Message acknowledgment” for more information.

=== The Message interface

The Message interface is the root interface for all Jakarta Messaging messages. It
defines the Jakarta Messaging message header fields, property facility and the
acknowledge method used for all messages.

=== Message selection

Many messaging applications need to filter and categorize the messages
they produce.

In the case where a message is sent to a single receiver, this can be
done with reasonable efficiency by putting the criteria in the message
and having the receiving client discard the ones it’s not interested in.

When a message is broadcast to many clients, it becomes useful to place
the criteria into the message header so that it is visible to the Jakarta Messaging
provider. This allows the provider to handle much of the filtering and
routing work that would otherwise need to be done by the application.

Jakarta Messaging provides a facility that allows clients to delegate message
selection to their Jakarta Messaging provider. This simplifies the work of the client
and allows Jakarta Messaging providers to eliminate the time and bandwidth they would
otherwise waste sending messages to clients that don’t need them.

Clients attach application-specific selection criteria to messages using
message properties. Clients specify message selection criteria using Jakarta Messaging
_message selector_ expressions.

==== Message selector

A Jakarta Messaging message selector allows a client to specify, by message header,
the messages it’s interested in. Only messages whose headers and
properties match the selector are delivered. The semantics of _not
delivered_ differ a bit depending on the MessageConsumer being used. See
section 4.1.2 “Queue semantics” and 4.2.2 “Topic semantics” for more
details.

Message selectors cannot reference message body values.

A message selector matches a message when the selector evaluates to true
when the message’s header field and property values are substituted for
their corresponding identifiers in the selector.

===== Message selector syntax

A message selector is a String whose syntax is based on a subset of the
SQL92footnote:[See X/Open CAE Specification Data Management: Structured
Query Language (SQL), Version 2, ISBN: 1-85912-151-9 March 1996.]
conditional expression syntax.

If the value of a message selector is an empty string, the value is
treated as a null and indicates that there is no message selector for
the message consumer.

The order of evaluation of a message selector is from left to right
within precedence level. Parentheses can be used to change this order.

Predefined selector literals and operator names are written here in
upper case; however, they are case insensitive.

A selector can contain:

* Literals:
** A string literal is enclosed in single quotes, with an included
single quote represented by doubled single quote; for example, 'literal'
and 'literal''s'. Like Java String literals, these use the Unicode
character encoding.
** An exact numeric literal is a numeric value without a decimal point,
such as 57, -957, +62; numbers in the range of Java long are supported.
Exact numeric literals use the Java integer literal syntax.
** An approximate numeric literal is a numeric value in scientific
notation, such as 7E3 and -57.9E2, or a numeric value with a decimal,
such as 7., -95.7, and +6.2; numbers in the range of Java double are
supported. Approximate literals use the Java floating-point literal
syntax.
** The boolean literals TRUE and FALSE.
* Identifiers:
** An identifier is an unlimited-length character sequence that must
begin with a Java identifier start character; all following characters
must be Java identifier part characters. An identifier start character
is any character for which the method Character.isJavaIdentifierStart
returns true. This includes '_' and '$'. An identifier part character is
any character for which the method Character.isJavaIdentifierPart
returns true.
** Identifiers cannot be the names NULL, TRUE, or FALSE.
** Identifiers cannot be NOT, AND, OR, BETWEEN, LIKE, IN, IS, or ESCAPE.
** Identifiers are either header field references or property
references. The type of a property value in a message selector
corresponds to the type used to set the property. If a property that
does not exist in a message is referenced, its value is NULL. The
semantics of evaluating NULL values in a selector are described in
Section 3.8.1.2 “Null values”.
** The conversions that apply to the get methods for properties do not
apply when a property is used in a message selector expression. For
example, suppose you set a property as a string value, as in the
following:
+
myMessage.setStringProperty("NumberOfOrders", "2");
+
The following expression in a message selector would evaluate to false,
because a string cannot be used in an arithmetic expression:
+
"NumberOfOrders > 1"
** Identifiers are case sensitive.
** Message header field references are restricted to JMSDeliveryMode,
JMSPriority, JMSMessageID, JMSTimestamp, JMSCorrelationID, and JMSType.
JMSMessageID, JMSCorrelationID, and JMSType values may be null and if so
are treated as a NULL value.
** Any name beginning with 'JMSX' is a Jakarta Messaging defined property name.
** Any name beginning with 'JMS_' is a provider-specific property name.
** Any name that does not begin with 'JMS' is an application-specific
property name.
* Whitespace is the same as that defined for Java: space, horizontal
tab, form feed and line terminator.
* Expressions:
** A selector is a conditional expression; a selector that evaluates to
true matches; a selector that evaluates to false or unknown does not
match.
** Arithmetic expressions are composed of themselves, arithmetic
operations, identifiers with numeric values, and numeric literals.
** Conditional expressions are composed of themselves, comparison
operations, logical operations, identifiers with boolean values, and
boolean literals.
* Standard bracketing () for ordering expression evaluation is
supported.
* Logical operators in precedence order: NOT, AND, OR
* Comparison operators: =, >, >=, <, <=, <> (not equal)
** Only like type values can be compared. One exception is that it is
valid to compare exact numeric values and approximate numeric values
(the type conversion required is defined by the rules of Java numeric
promotion). If the comparison of non-like type values is attempted, the
value of the operation is false. If either of the type values evaluates
to NULL, the value of the expression is unknown.
** String and Boolean comparison is restricted to = and <>. Two strings
are equal if and only if they contain the same sequence of characters.
* Arithmetic operators in precedence order:
** +, - (unary)
** *, / (multiplication and division)
** +, - (addition and subtraction)
** Arithmetic operations must use Java numeric promotion.
* _arithmetic-expr1_ [NOT] BETWEEN _arithmetic-expr2_ and
_arithmetic-expr3_ (comparison operator)
** "age BETWEEN 15 AND 19" is equivalent to "age >= 15 AND age <= 19"
** "age NOT BETWEEN 15 AND 19" is equivalent to "age < 15 OR age > 19"
* _identifier_ [NOT] IN (_string-literal1_, _string-literal2_,...)
(comparison operator where _identifier_ has a String or NULL value).
** "Country IN ('UK', 'US', 'France')" is true for 'UK' and false for
'Peru'; it is equivalent to the expression (Country = 'UK') OR (Country
= 'US') OR (Country = 'France')
** Country NOT IN ('UK', 'US', 'France') is false for 'UK' and true for
'Peru'; it is equivalent to the expression "NOT ((Country = 'UK') OR
(Country = 'US') OR (Country = 'France'))"
** If identifier of an IN or NOT IN operation is NULL, the value of the
operation is unknown.
* _identifier_ [NOT] LIKE _pattern-value_ [ESCAPE _escape-character_]
(comparison operator, where _identifier_ has a String value;
_pattern-value_ is a string literal where '\_' stands for any single
character; '%' stands for any sequence of characters, including the
empty sequence, and all other characters stand for themselves. The
optional __escape-character__ is a single-character string literal whose
character is used to escape the special meaning of the '_' and '%' in
pattern-value.)
** "phone LIKE '12%3'" is true for '123' or '12993' and false for '1234'
** "word LIKE 'l_se'" is true for 'lose' and false for 'loose'
** "underscored LIKE '_%' ESCAPE '\'" is true for '_foo' and false for
'bar'
** "phone NOT LIKE '12%3'" is false for '123' and '12993' and true for
'1234'
** If _identifier_ of a LIKE or NOT LIKE operation is NULL, the value of
the operation is unknown.
* _identifier_ IS NULL (comparison operator that tests for a null header
field value or a missing property value)
** "prop_name IS NULL"
* _identifier IS NOT NULL_ (comparison operator that tests for the
existence of a non-null header field value or property value)
** "prop_name IS NOT NULL"

Jakarta Messaging providers are required to verify the syntactic correctness of a
message selector at the time it is presented. A method providing a
syntactically incorrect selector must result in a Jakarta Messaging
InvalidSelectorException. Jakarta Messaging providers may also optionally provide some
semantic checking at the time the selector is presented. Not all
semantic checking can be performed at the time a message selector is
presented, because property types are not known.

The following message selector selects messages with a message type of
_car_ and color of _blue_ and weight greater than 2500 lbs:

"JMSType = 'car' AND color = 'blue' AND weight > 2500"

===== Null values

As noted above, header fields and property values may be NULL. The
evaluation of selector expressions containing NULL values is defined by
SQL 92 NULL semantics. A brief description of these semantics is
provided here.

SQL treats a NULL value as unknown. Comparison or arithmetic with an
unknown value always yields an unknown value.

The IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators convert an unknown header or
property value into the respective TRUE and FALSE values.

The boolean operators use three-valued logic as defined by the following
tables:

Table 3‑4 The definition of the AND operator

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|AND |T |F |U
|T |T |F |U
|F |F |F |F
|U |U |F |U
|===

Table 3‑5 The definition of the OR operator

[cols=",,,",options="header",]

|F |T |F |U
|U |T |U |U
|===

Table 3‑6 The definition of the NOT operator

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|NOT |
|T |F
|F |T
|U |U
|===

===== Special notes

When used in a message selector _JMSDeliveryMode_ is treated as having
the values 'PERSISTENT' and 'NON_PERSISTENT'.

Date and time values should use the standard Java long millisecond
value. When a date or time literal is included in a message selector, it
should be an integer literal for a millisecond value. The standard way
to produce millisecond values is to use java.util.Calendar.

Although SQL supports fixed decimal comparison and arithmetic, Jakarta Messaging
message selectors do not. This is the reason for restricting exact
numeric literals to those without a decimal (and the addition of
numerics with a decimal as an alternate representation for approximate
numeric values).

SQL comments are not supported.

=== Access to sent messages

After sending a message, a client may retain and modify it without
affecting the message that has been sent. The same message object may be
sent multiple times.

During the execution of its sending method, the message must not be
changed by the client. If it is modified, the result of the send is
undefined.

=== Changing the value of a received message

When a message is received, its header field values can be changed;
however, its property entries and its body are read-only, as specified
in this chapter.

The rationale for the read-only restriction is that it gives Jakarta Messaging
Providers more freedom in how they implement the management of received
messages. For instance, they may return a message object that references
property entries and body values that reside in an internal message
buffer rather than being forced to make a copy.

A consumer can modify a received message after calling either the
clearBody or clearProperties method to make the body or properties
writable. If the consumer modifies a received message, and the message
is subsequently redelivered, the redelivered message must be the
original, unmodified message (except for headers and properties modified
by the Jakarta Messaging provider as a result of the redelivery, such as the
JMSRedelivered header and the JMSXDeliveryCount property).

=== Jakarta Messaging message body

Jakarta Messaging provides five forms of message body. Each form is defined by a
message interface:

* StreamMessage - a message whose body contains a stream of Java
primitive values. It is filled and read sequentially.
* MapMessage - a message whose body contains a set of name-value pairs
where names are String objects and values are Java primitive types. The
entries can be accessed sequentially by enumerator or randomly by name.
The order of the entries is undefined.
* TextMessage - a message whose body contains a java.lang.String. The
inclusion of this message type is based on our presumption that String
messages will be used extensively. One reason for this is that XML will
likely become a popular mechanism for representing the content of Jakarta Messaging
messages.
* ObjectMessage - a message that contains a serializable Java object. If
a collection of Java objects is needed, one of the collection classes
provided in JDK 1.2 can be used.
* BytesMessage - a message that contains a stream of uninterpreted
bytes. This message type is for literally encoding a body to match an
existing message format. In many cases, it will be possible to use one
of the other, self-defining, message types instead. _Although Jakarta Messaging allows
the use of message properties with byte messages it is typically not
done since the inclusion of properties may affect the format._

==== Clearing a message body

The clearBody method of Message resets the value of the message body to
the ‘empty’ initial message value as set by the message type’s create
method provided by Session. Clearing a message’s body does not clear its
property entries.

==== Read-only message body

When a message is received, its body is read only. If an attempt is made
to change the body a MessageNotWriteableException must be thrown. If its
body is subsequently cleared, the body is in the same state as an empty
body in a newly created message.

==== Conversions provided by StreamMessage and MapMessage

Both StreamMessage and MapMessage support the same set of primitive data
types.

The types can be read or written explicitly using methods for each type.
They may also be read or written generically as objects. For instance, a
call to MapMessage.setInt("foo", 6) is equivalent to
MapMessage.setObject("foo", new Integer(6)). Both forms are provided
because the explicit form is convenient for static programming and the
object form is needed when types are not known at compile time.

Both StreamMessage and MapMessage support the following conversion
table. The marked cases must be supported. The unmarked cases must throw
a Jakarta Messaging MessageFormatException. The String to numeric conversions must
throw a java.lang.NumberFormatException if the numeric’s valueOf()
method does not accept the String value as a valid representation.

StreamMessage and MapMessage must implement the String to boolean
conversion as specified by the valueOf(String) method of Boolean as
defined by the Java language.

Attempting to read a null value as a Java primitive type must be treated
as calling the primitive’s corresponding valueOf(String) conversion
method with a null value. Since char does not support a String
conversion, attempting to read a null value as a char must throw
NullPointerException.

Getting a MapMessage field for a field name that has not been set is
handled as if the field exists with a null value.

If a read method of StreamMessage or BytesMessage throws a
MessageFormatException or NumberFormatException, the current position of
the read pointer must not be incremented. A subsequent read must be
capable of recovering from the exception by rereading the data as a
different type.

A value written as the row type can be read as the column type

==== Messages for non-Jakarta Messaging clients

A number of enterprise messaging systems support some form of
self-defining stream and/or map native message type. Although clients
could use BytesMessage to construct native messages of this form, Jakarta Messaging
provides the StreamMessage and MapMessage types as a more convenient
API.

For instance, when a client is using a Jakarta Messaging provider that supports a
native map message; and, it wishes to send a map message that can be
read by both Jakarta Messaging and native clients, it uses a MapMessage. When the
message is sent, the provider translates it into its native form. Native
clients can then receive it. If a Jakarta Messaging provider receives it, the provider
translates it back into a MapMessage.

Even when a new Jakarta Messaging application with newly defined messages is written,
the application may choose to use StreamMessage and MapMessage to ensure
that later, non-Jakarta Messaging clients will be able to read them.

If a Jakarta Messaging client sends a StreamMessage or MapMessage, it must be
translated by a receiving Jakarta Messaging provider into an equivalent StreamMessage
or MapMessage. When passed between Jakarta Messaging clients, a message must always
retain its full form. For instance, a message sent as MapMessage must
not arrive at a Jakarta Messaging client as a BytesMessage.

If a Jakarta Messaging provider receives a message created by a native client, the
provider should do its best to transform it into the ‘best’ Jakarta Messaging message
type. For instance, if it is a native stream message it should be
transformed into a StreamMessage. If this is not possible, the provider
is always able to transform it into a BytesMessage.

=== Provider implementations of Jakarta Messaging message interfaces

Jakarta Messaging provides a set of message interfaces that define the Jakarta Messaging message
model. It does not provide implementations of these interfaces.

Each Jakarta Messaging provider provides its own implementation of its Session’s
message creation methods. This allows a provider to use message
implementations that are tailored to its needs.

A provider must be prepared to accept, from a client, a message whose
implementation is _not_ one of its own. A message with a ‘foreign’
implementation may not be handled as efficiently as a provider’s own
implementation; however, it must be handled.

The Jakarta Messaging message interfaces provide write/set methods for setting object
values in a message body and message properties. All of these methods
must be implemented to copy their input objects into the message. The
value of an input object is allowed to be null and will return null when
accessed. One exception to this is that BytesMessage does not support
the concept of a null stream and attempting to write a null into it must
throw java.lang.NullPointerException.

The Jakarta Messaging message interfaces provide read/get methods for accessing
objects in a message body and message properties. All of these methods
must be implemented to return a copy of the accessed message objects.

== Messaging domains

Jakarta Messaging supports two styles of messaging:

* point-to-point (PTP) messaging using _queues_
* publish-and-subscribe (pub/sub)messaging using _topics_

=== Jakarta Messaging point-to-point model

==== Overview

Point-to-point systems are about working with queues of messages. They
are point-to-point in that a client sends a message to a specific queue.
Some PTP systems blur the distinction between PTP and pub/sub by
providing system clients that automatically distribute messages.

It is common for a client to have all its messages delivered to a single
queue.

Like any generic mailbox, a queue can contain a mixture of messages.
And, like real mailboxes, creating and maintaining each queue is
somewhat costly. Most queues are created administratively and are
treated as static resources by their clients.

The Jakarta Messaging PTP model defines how a client works with queues: how it finds
them, how it sends messages to them, and how it receives messages from
them.

==== Queue semantics

When point-to-point messaging is being used, an application sends
messages to a _queue_.

An application may consume messages from the queue by creating a
consumer (a MessageConsumer, JMSConsumer or QueueReceiver object) on
that queue. A consumer may be used to consume messages either
synchronously or asynchronously.

A queue may have more than one consumer. Each message in the queue is
delivered to only one consumer.

A consumer may be configured to use a message selector. In this case
only messages whose properties match the message selector will be
delivered to the consumer. Messages which are not selected remain on the
queue or are delivered to another consumer.

The order in which an individual consumer receives messages is described
in section 6.2.9 “Message order” below.

By definition, if a consumer uses a message selector, or there are other
consumers on the same queue, then a consumer may not receive all the
messages on the queue. However those messages that are delivered to the
consumer will be delivered in the order defined in section 6.2.9.

Apart from the requirements of any message selectors, Jakarta Messaging does not
define how messages are distributed between multiple consumers on the
same queue.

==== Queue management

Jakarta Messaging does not define facilities for creating, administering, or deleting
long-lived queues (it does provide such a mechanism for temporary
queues). Since most clients use statically defined queues this is not a
problem.

==== Queue

A Queue object encapsulates a provider-specific queue name. It is the
way a client specifies the identity of a queue to Jakarta Messaging methods.

The actual length of time messages are held by a queue and the
consequences of resource overflow are not defined by Jakarta Messaging.

See chapter 5 “Administered objects” for more information about Jakarta Messaging
Destination objects.

==== TemporaryQueue

A TemporaryQueue is a unique Queue object created for the duration of a
connection. It is a system-defined queue that can only be consumed by
the connection that created it.

See Section 6.2.2 “Creating temporary destinations” for more
information.

==== QueueBrowser

A client uses a QueueBrowser to look at messages on a queue without
removing them. A QueueBrowser can be created from a JMSContext, Session
or QueueSession.

The browse methods return a java.util.Enumeration that is used to scan
the queue’s messages. It may be an enumeration of the entire content of
a queue, or it may contain only the messages matching a message
selector.

Messages may be arriving and expiring while the scan is done. Jakarta Messaging does
not require the content of an enumeration to be a static snapshot of
queue content. Whether these changes are visible or not depends on the
Jakarta Messaging provider.

A message must not be returned by a QueueBrowser before its delivery
time has been reached.

==== QueueRequestor

The legacy domain-specific API for point-to-point messaging provides a
QueueRequestor helper class to simplify making service requests.

The QueueRequestor constructor is given a non-transacted QueueSession
and a destination queue. It creates a TemporaryQueue for the responses
and provides a request method that sends the request message and waits
for its reply.

This is a very basic request/reply abstraction which assumes the session
is non-transacted with a delivery mode of either AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or
DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE. It is expected that most applications will create
less basic implementations.

There is no equivalent to this class for the classic or simplified APIs.
Applications using these APIs are expected to create their own
implementations.

==== Reliability

A queue is typically created by an administrator and exists for a long
time. It is always available to hold messages sent to it, whether or not
the client that consumes its messages is active. For this reason, a
client does not have to take any special precautions to ensure it does
not miss messages.

=== Jakarta Messaging publish/subscribe model

==== Overview

The Jakarta Messaging pub/sub model defines how Jakarta Messaging clients publish messages to, and
subscribe to messages from, a well-known node in a content-based
hierarchy. Jakarta Messaging calls these nodes _topics_.

In pub/sub messaging, the term _publish is sometimes used to refer to
the act of sending messages to a topic instead of the more generic terms
send or produce._

_The term subscribe is used to refer to the act of_ registering an
interest _in a topic. This creates a subscription from which a client
consumes or receives messages._

A topic can be thought of as a mini message broker that gathers and
distributes messages addressed to it. By relying on the topic as an
intermediary, message publishers are kept independent of subscribers and
vice versa. The topic automatically adapts as both publishers and
subscribers come and go.

==== Topic semantics

When pub/sub messaging is being used, an application sends messages to a
_topic_.

An application consumes messages from a topic by creating a
_subscription_ on that topic, and creating a consumer (a
MessageConsumer, JMSConsumer or TopicSubscriber object) on that
subscription.

A subscription may be thought of as an entity within the Jakarta Messaging provider
itself whereas a consumer is a Jakarta Messaging object within the application.

A subscription will receive a copy of every message that is sent to the
topic after the subscription is created, except if a message selector is
specified. If a message selector is specified then only those messages
whose properties match the message selector will be added to the
subscription.

Each copy of the message is treated as a completely separate message.
Work done on one copy has no effect on any other; acknowledging one does
not acknowledge any other; one message may be delivered immediately,
while another waits for its consumer to process messages ahead of it.

Some subscriptions are restricted to a single consumer. In this case all
the messages in the subscription are delivered to that consumer. Some
subscriptions allow multiple consumers. In this case each message in the
subscription is delivered to only one consumer. Jakarta Messaging does not define how
messages are distributed between multiple consumers on the same
subscription.

The order in which messages are delivered to a consumer is described in
section 6.2.9 “Message order” below. By definition, if a subscription
uses a message selector, or there are other consumers on the same
subscription, then a consumer may not receive all the messages sent to
the topic. However those messages that are delivered to the consumer
will be delivered in the order defined in section 6.2.9.

Subscriptions may be _durable_ or _non-durable_.

A _non-durable subscription_ only exists for as long as there is an
active consumer on the subscription. This means that any messages sent
to the topic will only be added to the subscription whilst a consumer
exists and is not closed.

A non-durable subscription may be either _unshared_ or _shared_.

* An _unshared non-durable subscription_ does not have a name and may
have only a single consumer object associated with it. It is created
automatically when the consumer object is created. It is not persisted
and is deleted automatically when the consumer object is closed. See
section 8.3.1 “Unshared non-durable subscriptions” .
* A _shared non-durable subscription_ is identified by name and an
optional client identifier, and may have several consumer objects
consuming messages from it. It is created automatically when the first
consumer object is created. It is not persisted and is deleted
automatically when the last consumer object is closed. See section 8.3.2
“Shared non-durable subscriptions” below.

At the cost of higher overhead, a subscription may be _durable_. A
_durable subscription_ is persisted and continues to accumulate messages
until explicitly deleted, even if there are no consumer objects
consuming messages from it.

A durable subscription has a unique identity that is retained by Jakarta Messaging.
Subsequent consumer objects can resume the subscription in the state it
was left by the prior consumer. If there are no active consumers on a
durable subscription, Jakarta Messaging retains the subscription’s messages until they
are consumed or until they expire.

A durable subscription may also be either _unshared_ or _shared_.

* An _unshared durable subscription_ is identified by name and client
identifier (which must be set) and may have only a single consumer
object associated with it. See section 8.3.3 “Unshared durable
subscriptions”
* A _shared durable subscription_ is identified by name and an optional
client identifier, and may have several consumer objects consuming
messages from it. See section 8.3.4 “Shared durable subscriptions”
below.
+
A durable subscription which exists but which does not currently have a
non-closed consumer object associated with it is described as being
_inactive_.

When an unshared non-durable or durable subscription is created, the
noLocal parameter may be specified. The effect of setting this parameter
is defined in sections 8.3.1 “Unshared non-durable subscriptions” and 8.3.3
“Unshared durable subscriptions” below.

==== Pub/sub latency

Since there is typically some latency in all pub/sub systems, the exact
messages seen by a subscriber may vary depending on how quickly a Jakarta Messaging
provider propagates the existence of a new subscriber and the length of
time a provider retains messages in transit.

For instance, some messages from a distant publisher may be missed
because it may take a second for the existence of a new subscriber to be
propagated system wide. When a new subscriber is created, it may receive
messages sent earlier because a provider may still have them available.

Jakarta Messaging does not define the exact semantics that apply during the interval
when a pub/sub provider is adjusting to a new client. Jakarta Messaging semantics only
apply once the provider has reached a ‘steady state’ with respect to a
new client.

==== Subscription name characters and length

The Jakarta Messaging provider must allow a durable or non-durable subscription name
to contain the following characters:

* Java letters
* Java digits
* Underscore (_)
* Dot (.)
* Minus (-)

Jakarta Messaging providers may support additional characters to these, but
applications which use them may not be portable.

The Jakarta Messaging provider must allow a durable or non-durable subscription name
to have up to 128 characters.

Jakarta Messaging providers may support names longer than this, but applications which
use longer names may not be portable.

==== Topic management

Some products require that topics be statically defined with associated
authorization control lists, and so on; others don’t even have the
concept of topic administration.

Jakarta Messaging does not define facilities for creating, administering, or deleting
topics.

A special type of topic called a _temporary topic_ is provided for
creating a _topic_ that is unique to a _particular connection_. See
Section 4.2.7 “Temporary topics” for more details.

==== Topic

A Topic object encapsulates a provider-specific topic name. It is the
way a client specifies the identity of a topic to Jakarta Messaging methods.

Many Jakarta Messaging providers group topics into hierarchies and provide various
options for subscribing to parts of the hierarchy. Jakarta Messaging places no
restriction on what a Topic object represents. It might be a leaf in a
topic hierarchy or it might be a larger part of the hierarchy (for
subscribing to a general class of information).

The organization of topics and the granularity of subscriptions to them
is an important part of a pub/sub application’s architecture. Jakarta Messaging does
not specify a policy for how this should be done. If an application
takes advantage of a provider-specific topic grouping mechanism, it
should document this. If the application is installed using a different
provider, it is the job of the administrator to construct an equivalent
topic architecture and create equivalent Topic objects.

==== Temporary topics

A TemporaryTopic is a unique Topic object created for the duration of a
JMSContext, Connection or TopicConnection. It is a system defined Topic
whose messages may be consumed only by the connection that created it.

By definition, it does not make sense to create a durable subscription
to a temporary topic. To do this is a programming error that may or may
not be detected by a Jakarta Messaging Provider.

See Section 6.2.2 “Creating temporary destinations” for more
information.

==== Recovery and redelivery

Unacknowledged messages of a nondurable subscriber should be able to be
recovered for the lifetime of that nondurable subscriber. When a
nondurable subscriber terminates, messages waiting for it will probably
be dropped by the Jakarta Messaging provider whether or not they have been
acknowledged.

Only durable subscriptions are reliably able to recover unacknowledged
messages.

Sending a message to a topic with a delivery mode of PERSISTENT does not
alter this model of recovery and redelivery. To ensure delivery, a
durable subscription should be used.

==== Administering subscriptions

Ideally, publishers and subscribers are dynamically registered by a
provider when they are created. From the client viewpoint this is always
the case. From the administrator’s viewpoint, other tasks may be needed
to support the creation of publishers and subscribers.

The amount of resources allocated for message storage and the
consequences of resource overflow are not defined by Jakarta Messaging.

All Jakarta Messaging providers must be able to run Jakarta Messaging applications that dynamically
create and delete durable subscriptions. Some Jakarta Messaging providers may, in
addition, provide facilities to administratively configure durable
subscriptions. If a durable subscription has been administratively
configured, it is valid for it to silently override the subscription
specified by the client.

==== TopicRequestor

The legacy domain-specific API for pub/sub messaging provides a
TopicRequestor helper class to simplify making service requests.

The TopicRequestor constructor is given a non-transacted TopicSession
and a destination topic. It creates a TemporaryTopic for the responses
and provides a request method that sends the request message and waits
for its reply.

This is a very basic request/reply abstraction which assumes the session
is non-transacted with a delivery mode of either AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or
DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE. It is expected that most applications will create
less basic implementations.

There is no equivalent to this class for the classic or simplified APIs.
Applications using these APIs are expected to create their own
implementations.

==== Reliability

When all messages for a topic must be received, a durable subscriber
should be used. Jakarta Messaging ensures that messages published while a durable
subscriber is inactive are retained by Jakarta Messaging and delivered when the
subscriber subsequently becomes active.

Non-durable subscribers should only be used when missed messages are
tolerable.

== Administered objects

=== Overview

Jakarta Messaging administered objects are objects containing Jakarta Messaging configuration
information that are created by a Jakarta Messaging administrator and later used by
Jakarta Messaging clients. They make it practical to administer Jakarta Messaging applications in
the enterprise.

_Although the interfaces for administered objects do not explicitly
depend on JNDI, Jakarta Messaging establishes the convention that Jakarta Messaging clients find
them by looking them up in a namespace using JNDI._

An administrator can place an administered object anywhere in a
namespace. Jakarta Messaging does not define a naming policy.

This strategy of partitioning Jakarta Messaging and administration provides several
benefits:

* It hides provider-specific configuration details from Jakarta Messaging clients.
* It abstracts Jakarta Messaging administrative information into Java objects that are
easily organized and administered from a common management console.
* Since there will be JNDI providers for all popular naming services,
this means Jakarta Messaging providers can deliver one implementation of administered
objects that will run everywhere.

An administered object should not hold on to any remote resources. Its
lookup should not use remote resources other than those used by JNDI
itself.

Clients should think of administered objects as local Java objects.
Looking them up should not have any hidden side effects or use
surprising amounts of local resources.

Jakarta Messaging defines two administered objects, Destination and ConnectionFactory.

It is expected that Jakarta Messaging providers will provide the tools an
administrator needs to create and configure administered objects in a
JNDI namespace. Jakarta Messaging provider implementations of administered objects
should be both javax.naming.Referenceable and java.io.Serializable so
that they can be stored in all JNDI naming contexts. In addition, it is
recommended that these implementations follow the JavaBeans^TM^ design
patterns.

=== Destination

Jakarta Messaging does not define a standard address syntax. Although this was
considered, it was decided that the differences in address semantics
between existing enterprise messaging products was too wide to bridge
with a single syntax. Instead, Jakarta Messaging defines the Destination object which
encapsulates provider-specific addresses.

Since Destination is an administered object it may also contain
provider-specific configuration information in addition to its address.

Jakarta Messaging also supports a client’s use of provider-specific address names. See
Section 6.2.3 “Creating Destination objects” for more information.

Destination objects support concurrent use.

=== Connection factories

A connection factory object encapsulates a set of connection
configuration parameters that has been defined by an administrator. A
client uses it to create a connection with a Jakarta Messaging provider.

* The classic API uses connection factories of type ConnectionFactory.
* The simplified API uses connection factories of type
ConnectionFactory.
* The domain-specific API for point-to-point messaging uses connection
factories of type QueueConnectionFactory.
* The domain-specified API for pub-sub messaging uses connection
factories of type TopicConnectionFactory.

Connection factory objects support concurrent use.

For information on how to use a connection factory to create a
connection, see section 6.1 “Connections”.

== Connecting to a Jakarta Messaging provider

=== Connections

Jakarta Messaging uses the term _connection_ to refer to a client’s active connection
to its Jakarta Messaging provider. It will typically allocate provider resources
outside the Java virtual machine.

A connection is created using a connection factory. For more information
about connection factories see section 5.3 “Connection factories”.

A connection may be used to create one or more sessions. Sessions are
used to send and consume messages and are described in section 6.2
“Sessions”.

* In the classic API a connection is represented by a Connection object
and is created using one of the following methods on ConnectionFactory:
+
createConnection()
+
createConnection(String userName, String password)
+
A Connection object may be used to create separate Session objects.
Connection objects support concurrent use.
* In the simplified API a connection is represented by a JMSContext
object and is created using one of the following methods on
ConnectionFactory.
+
createContext()
+
createContext(int sessionMode)
+
createContext(String userName, String password)
+
createContext(String userName, String password, int sessionMode)
+
A JMSContext represents both a connection and a session. Although a
connection supports concurrent use, a session does not. JMSContext
objects therefore do not support concurrent use
* In the domain-specific API for point-to-point messaging a connection
is represented by a QueueConnection object and is created using one of
the following methods on QueueConnectionFactory:
+
createQueueConnection()
+
createQueueConnection(String userName, String password)
+
A QueueConnection object may be used to create separate QueueSession
objects. QueueConnection objects support concurrent use.
* In the domain-specified API for pub-sub messaging a connection is
represented by a TopicConnection object and is created using one of the
following methods on TopicConnectionFactory:
+
createTopicConnection()
+
createTopicConnection(String userName, String password)
+
A TopicConnection object may be used to create separate TopicSession
objects. TopicConnection objects support concurrent use.

A connection serves several purposes:

* It encapsulates an open connection with a Jakarta Messaging provider. It typically
represents an open TCP/IP socket between a client and a provider’s
service daemon.
* Its creation is when client authentication takes place.
* It can specify a unique client identifier.
* It provides ConnectionMetaData.
* It supports an optional ExceptionListener.

Due to the authentication and communication setup done when a connection
is created, the objects that represent a connection are relatively
heavyweight Jakarta Messaging objects. Most clients will do all their messaging with a
single connection. Other more advanced applications may use several
connections. Jakarta Messaging does not architect a reason for using multiple
connections (other than when a client acts as a gateway between two
different providers); however, there may be operational reasons for
doing so.

==== Authentication

When creating a connection, a client may specify its credentials as
name/password.

If no credentials are specified, the current thread’s credentials are
used. At this point, the JDK does not define the concept of a thread’s
default credentials; however, it is likely this will be defined in the
near future. For now, the identity of the user under which the Jakarta Messaging
client is running should be used.

==== Client identifier

The preferred way to assign a client’s client identifier is for it to be
configured in a client-specific ConnectionFactory and transparently
assigned to the connection it creates. Alternatively, a client can set a
connection’s client identifier using a provider-specific value. The
facility to explicitly set a connection’s client identifier is not a
mechanism for overriding the identifier that has been administratively
configured. It is provided for the case where no administratively
specified identifier exists. If one does exist, an attempt to change it
by setting it must throw an IllegalStateException.

An application may explicitly set a connection's client identifier by
calling the setClientID method on the Connection, JMSContext,
QueueConnection or TopicConnection object.

If a client explicitly sets a connection's client identifier it must do
so immediately after creating the Connection, JMSContext,
QueueConnection or TopicConnection and before any other action on this
object taken. After this point, setting the client identifier is a
programming error that should throw an IllegalStateException.

The purpose of client identifier is to associate a connection and its
objects with a state maintained on behalf of the client by a provider.
By definition, the client state identified by a client identifier can be
‘in use’ by only one client at a time. A Jakarta Messaging provider must prevent
concurrently executing clients from using it.

This prevention may take the form of a JMSException being thrown when
such use is attempted; it may result in the offending client being
blocked; or some other solution. A Jakarta Messaging provider must ensure that such
attempted ‘sharing’ of an individual client state does not result in
messages being lost or doubly processed.

The only use of a client identifier defined by Jakarta Messaging is its mandatory use
in identifying an unshared durable subscription or its optional use in
identifying a shared durable or non-durable subscription.

==== Connection setup

* In the classic API, a Jakarta Messaging client typically creates a Connection, one
or more Session objects, and a number of MessageProducer and
MessageConsumer objects.
* In the simplified API, a Jakarta Messaging client typically creates a JMSContext and
a number of JMSProducer and JMSConsumer objects.
* In the domain-specific API for point-to-point messaging, a Jakarta Messaging client
typically creates a QueueConnection, one or more QueueSession objects,
and a number of QueueSender and QueueReceiver objects.
* In the domain-specific API for pub/sub messaging, a Jakarta Messaging client
typically creates a TopicConnection, one or more TopicSession objects,
and a number of TopicPublisher and TopicSubscriber objects.

==== Starting a connection

When a Connection, JMSContext, QueueConnection or TopicConnection is
created, it is in _stopped_ mode. That means that no messages are being
delivered to it.

In the case of a Connection, QueueConnection or TopicConnection it is
typical to leave the connection in stopped mode until setup is complete.
At that point the start method is called and messages begin arriving at
the connection’s consumers. This setup convention minimizes any client
confusion that may result from asynchronous message delivery while the
client is still in the process of setting itself up.

These objects can be started immediately and the setup can be done
afterwards. Clients that do this must be prepared to handle asynchronous
message delivery while they are still in the process of setting up.

In the case of a JMSContext the connection is started automatically when
the first consumer is created. Applications may disable this behaviour
by calling setAutoStart(false) and then calling start() explicitly when
required.

Whether a connection is started or stopped only affects the use of a
connection to _receive_ messages. It has no effect on the use of the
connection to _send_ messages. A connection may be used to send messages
irrespective of whether it is started or stopped.

It is important to note that clients rely on the fact that no messages
will be delivered to a consumer until its connection has been started.
Jakarta Messaging Providers must ensure that this is the case.

==== Pausing delivery of incoming messages

A connection’s delivery of incoming messages can be temporarily stopped
using its stop method. It can be restarted using its start method. When
stopped, delivery to all the connection’s consumer objects is inhibited:
synchronous receives block, and messages are not delivered to any
message listeners.

Stopping a connection has no affect on its ability to send messages.
Stopping a stopped connection and starting a started connection are
ignored.

A stop method call must not return until delivery of messages has
paused. This means a client can rely on the fact that none of its
message listeners will be called and all threads of control waiting for
receive to return will not return with a message until the connection is
restarted. The receive timers for a stopped connection continue to
advance so receives may time out and return a null message while the
connection is stopped.

If any message listeners are running when stop is invoked, stop must
wait until all of them have returned before it may return. While these
message listeners are completing, they must have the full services of
the connection available to them.

If the stop method is called from a message listener on its own
Connection or JMSContext, or on a JMSContext that uses the same
connection, then it will either fail and throw a
jakarta.jms.IllegalStateException (in the case of +
Connection) or jakarta.jms.IllegalStateRuntimeException (in the case of
JMSContext), or it will succeed and stop the connection, blocking until
all other message listeners that may have been running have returned.

Since two alternative behaviors are permitted in this case,
applications +
should avoid calling stop from a message listener on its own Connection
or JMSContext, or on a JMSContext that uses the same connection, because
this is not portable.

==== ConnectionMetaData

All the objects that represent a connection provide a ConnectionMetaData
object. This object provides the latest version of Jakarta Messaging supported by the
provider as well as the provider’s product name and version.

It also provides a list of the Jakarta Messaging defined property names supported by
the connection.

==== ExceptionListener

If a Jakarta Messaging provider detects a problem with a connection, it will inform
the connection’s ExceptionListener, if one has been registered. To
retrieve an ExceptionListener, the Jakarta Messaging provider calls the connection’s
getExceptionListener() method. This method returns the ExceptionListener
for the connection. If no ExceptionListener is registered, the value
null is returned__.__ The connection can then use the listener by
calling the listener’s onException() method, passing it a JMSException
describing the problem.

This allows a client to be asynchronously notified of a problem. Some
connections only consume messages, so they would have no other way to
learn their connection has failed.

A Connection serializes execution of its ExceptionListener.This means
that if a connection encounters multiple problems and therefore needs to
call its ExceptionListener multiple times, then it will only invoke
onException from one thread at a time. However if the same
ExceptionListener is registered with multiple connections then it is
undefined whether these connections could call onException from
different threads simultaneously.

A Jakarta Messaging provider should attempt to resolve connection problems itself
prior to notifying the client of them.

The exceptions delivered to ExceptionListener are those that have no
other place to be reported. If an exception is thrown on a Jakarta Messaging call it,
by definition, must not be delivered to an ExceptionListener (in other
words, ExceptionListener is not for the purpose of monitoring all
exceptions thrown by a connection).

There is no restriction on the use of the Jakarta Messaging API by the listener's
onException method. However since that method will only be called when
there is a serious problem with the connection, any attempt to use that
connection may fail and cause exceptions.

==== Closing a connection

Since a provider typically allocates significant resources outside the
JVM on behalf of a connection, clients should close them when they are
not needed. Relying on garbage collection to eventually reclaim these
resources may not be timely enough.

A close terminates all pending message receives on the connection’s
session’s consumers. The receives may return with a message or null
depending on whether there was a message or not available at the time of
the close.

Note that in this case, the message consumer will likely get an
exception if it is attempting to use the facilities of the now closed
connection while processing its last message. A developer must take this
‘last message’ case into account when writing a message consumer. It
bears repeating that the message consumer cannot rely on a null return
value to indicate this ‘last message’ case.

If one or more of the connection’s session’s message listeners is
processing a message at the point when connection close is invoked, all
the facilities of the connection and its sessions must remain available
to those listeners until they return control to the Jakarta Messaging provider.

When connection close is invoked it should not return until message
processing has been shut down in an orderly fashion. This means that all
message listeners that may have been running have returned, and that all
pending receives have returned.

Closing a Connection, QueueConnection or TopicConnection closes its
constituent sessions, producers, consumers or queue browsers. The
connection close is sufficient to signal the Jakarta Messaging provider that all
resources for the connection should be released.

Closing a JMSContext closes the underlying session and any underlying
producers and consumers. If there are no other active (not closed)
JMSContext objects using the underlying connection then this method also
closes the underlying connection.

If a message listener attempts to close its own connection (either by
calling +
close on a Connection object or by calling close on a JMSContext object
which has no other active JMSContext objects using the underlying
connection) then it will either fail and throw a
jakarta.jms.IllegalStateException (in the case of Connection) or
jakarta.jms.IllegalStateRuntimeException (in the case of JMSContext), or
it will succeed and close the connection, blocking until all other
message listeners that may have been running have returned, and all
pending receive calls have completed. If close succeeds and the
acknowledge mode of the session is set to AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE, the current
message will still be acknowledged automatically when the onMessage call
completes.

Since two alternative behaviors are permitted in this case,
applications +
should avoid calling close from a message listener on its own
Connection +
or JMSContext because this is not portable.

The Connection, JMSContext, QueueConnection and TopicConnection
interfaces all extend the java.lang.AutoCloseable interface. This means
that applications which create these objects in a try-with-resources
statement do not need to call the close method when they are no longer
needed. Instead these objects will be closed automatically at the end of
the statement. The use of a try-with-resources statement also simplifies
the handling of any exceptions thrown by the close method. See the Java
Tutorialsfootnote:[The Java Tutorials may be found at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html.] for more information
about the try-with-resources statement.

Closing a connection must rollback the transactions in progress on its
transacted sessionsfootnote:[The term ‘transacted session’ refers to the
case where a session’s commit and rollback methods are used to demarcate
a transaction local to the session. In the case where a session’s work
is coordinated by an external transaction manager, a session’s commit
and rollback methods are not used and the result of a closed session’s
work is determined later by the transaction manager.]. Closing a
connection does NOT force an acknowledge of client acknowledged
sessions. Invoking the acknowledge method of a received message from a
closed connection’s sessions must throw an IllegalStateException. These
semantics ensure that closing a connection does not cause messages to be
lost for queues and durable subscriptions which require reliable
processing by a subsequent execution of their Jakarta Messaging client.

Once a connection has been closed, an attempt to use it or its sessions
or their message consumers and producers must throw an
IllegalStateException (calls to the close method of these objects must
be ignored). It is valid to continue to use message objects created or
received via the connection with the exception of a received message’s
acknowledge method.

Closing a closed connection must NOT throw an exception.

=== Sessions

In Jakarta Messaging a _session_ is a single-threaded contextfootnote:[There are no
restrictions on the number of threads that can use a session or any
objects it creates. The restriction is that the resources of a session
should not be used concurrently by multiple threads. It is up to the
user to ensure that this concurrency restriction is met. The simplest
way to do this is to use one thread. In the case of asynchronous
delivery, use one thread for setup in stopped mode and then start
asynchronous delivery. In more complex cases the user must provide
explicit synchronization.] for producing and consuming messages.
Although it may allocate provider resources outside the Java virtual
machine, it is considered a lightweight Jakarta Messaging object.

* In the classic API a session is represented by a Session object and is
creating using one of the following methods on Connection:
+
createSession()
+
createSession(boolean transacted, int acknowledgeMode)
+
createSession(int sessionMode)
* In the simplified API a connection and a session are represented by a
single JMSContext object. When a JMSContext is created the underlying
session is created automatically.
* In the domain-specific API for point-to-point messaging a session is
represented by a QueueSession object and is created using the following
method on QueueConnection:
+
createQueueSession(boolean transacted, int acknowledgeMode)
* In the domain-specified API for pub-sub messaging a session is
represented by a TopicSession object and is created using the following
method on TopicConnection:
+
createTopicSession(boolean transacted, int acknowledgeMode)

A session serves several purposes:

* It is a factory for producer and consumer objects. These are described
in chapter 7 “Sending messages” and chapter 8 “Receiving messages”.
* It is a factory for TemporaryTopic and TemporaryQueue objects.
* It provides a way to create Queue or Topic objects for those clients
that need to dynamically manipulate provider-specific destination names.
* It supplies provider-optimized message factories.
* It supports a single series of transactions that combine work spanning
this session’s producers and consumers into atomic units.
* It defines a serial order for the messages it consumes and the
messages it produces.
* It retains messages it consumes until they have been acknowledged.
* It serializes execution of MessageListener objects registered with it.
* It is a factory for QueueBrowser objects.
* It provides the unsubscribe method for deleting durable topic
subscriptions.

If there are messages that have been received from a queue but not
acknowledged when a session terminates, these messages must be retained
and redelivered when a consumer next accesses the queue.

If there are messages that have been received from a topic subscription
but not acknowledged when a session terminates, a durable subscriber
must retain and redeliver them; a nondurable subscriber need not do so.

==== Producer and consumer creation

A session can create and service multiple producer and consumer objects.
See section 7 “Sending messages” and section 8 “Receiving messages” for
information on their creation and use.

Although a session may create multiple producers and consumers, they are
restricted to serial use. In effect, only a single logical thread of
control can use them. This is explained in more detail later.

==== Creating temporary destinations

Although sessions are used to create temporary destinations, this is
only for convenience. Their scope is actually the entire connection.
Their lifetime is that of their connection and any of the connection’s
sessions are allowed to create a consumer for them.

Temporary destinations (TemporaryQueue or TemporaryTopic objects) are
destinations that are system-generated uniquely for their connection.
Only their own connection is allowed to create consumer objects for
them.

One typical use for a temporary destination is as the JMSReplyTo
destination for service requests.

Each TemporaryQueue or TemporaryTopic object is unique. It cannot be
copied.

Since temporary destinations may allocate resources outside the JVM,
they should be deleted if they are no longer needed. They will be
automatically deleted when they are garbage collected or when their
connection is closed.

==== Creating Destination objects

Most clients will use Destination objects that are Jakarta Messaging administered
objects that they have looked up via JNDI. This is the most portable
approach.

Some specialized clients may need to create Destination objects by
dynamically manufacturing one using a provider specific destination
name. Sessions provide a Jakarta Messaging provider-specific method for doing this.

==== Optimized message implementations

A session provides the following methods to create messages:
createMessage, createBytesMessage, createMapMessage,
createObjectMessage, createStreamMessage and createTextMessage.

These methods allow the Jakarta Messaging provider to create message implementations
which are optimized for that particular provider and allow the provider
to minimize its overhead for handling messages.

However the fact that these methods are provided on a session does not
mean that messages must be sent using a message producer created from
the same session. Messages may be sent using any session, not just the
session used to create the message.

Furthermore, sessions must be capable of sending all Jakarta Messaging messages
regardless of how they may be implemented. See section 3.12 “Provider
implementations of Jakarta Messaging message interfaces”.

==== Threading restrictions on a session

Sessions are designed for serial use by one thread at a time. The only
exception to this occurs during the orderly shutdown of the session or
its connection. See Section 6.1.8 “Closing a connection” and Section
6.2.15 “Closing a session” for further details.

One typical use is to have a thread call receive() on a consumer, which
blocks until a message arrives. The thread may then use one or more of
the session’s producer objects.

It is erroneous for a client to use a thread of control to attempt to
synchronously receive a message if there is already a client thread of
control waiting to receive a message in the same session.

Another typical use is to have one thread set up a session by creating
its producers and one or more asynchronous consumers. In this case, the
message producers are exclusively for the use of the consumers’ message
listeners. Since the session serializes execution of its consumers’
message listeners, they can safely share the resources of their session.

If a connection is left in stopped mode while its sessions are being set
up, a client does not have to deal with messages arriving before the
client is fully prepared to handle them. This is the preferred strategy
because it eliminates the possibility of unanticipated conflicts between
setup and message processing. It is possible to create and set up a
session while a connection is receiving messages. In this case, more
care is required to ensure that a session’s message producers, message
consumers and message listeners are created in the right order. For
instance, a bad order may cause a MessageListener to use a producer
object that has yet to be created; or messages may arrive in the wrong
order due to the order in which MessageListener objects are registered.

If a client desires to have one thread producing messages while others
consume them, the client should use a separate session for its producing
thread.

Once a connection has been started, all its sessions with a registered
message listener are dedicated to the thread of control that delivers
messages to them. It is erroneous for client code to use such a session
from another thread of control. The only exception to this is the use of
the consumer, session or connection close method.

One consequence of the session’s single-thread-of-control restriction is
that a session with message listeners cannot also be used to
synchronously receive messages. Either the session is dedicated to the
thread of control used for delivery to message listeners, or it is
dedicated to a thread of control initiated by client code. It is
erroneous to attempt to combine both in the same session.

Another consequence is that a connection must be in stopped mode to set
up a session with more than one message listener. The reason is that
when a connection is actively delivering messages, once the first
message listener for a session has been registered, the session is now
controlled by the thread of control that delivers messages to it. At
this point a client thread of control cannot be used to further
configure the session.

It should be natural for most clients to partition their work into
sessions. This model allows clients to start simply and incrementally
add message processing complexity as their need for concurrency grows.

Since a JMSContext incorporates a session it is subject to the same
threading restrictions as a Session. For more information, and an
exception to this, see section 6.2.6 “Threading restrictions on a
JMSContext”.

Additional threading restrictions apply to applications which perform an
asynchronous send. See section 7.3 “Asynchronous send” and in particular
section 7.3.7 “Restrictions on threading”.

==== Threading restrictions on a JMSContext

Since a JMSContext incorporates a session it is subject to the same
threading restrictions as a session. These are described in section
6.2.5 “Threading restrictions on a session” which explains how a session
may only be used by one thread at a time.

The JMSContext method createContext does not use its underlying session
and so is not subject to this threading restriction.

This restriction also does not apply to the close method on JMSContext
or JMSConsumer (since closing a session or consumer from another thread
is permitted).

By default, when createConsumer or createDurableConsumer is used to
create a JMSConsumer the connection will automatically be started. This
behaviour is described in section 6.1.4 “Starting a connection”. It
means that if setMessageListener is called to configure the asynchronous
delivery of messages then the JMSContext’s session will immediately
become dedicated to the thread of control that delivers messages to the
listener and the application must not subsequently call methods on the
JMSContext from another thread of control. However this restriction does
not apply to applications which call setMessageListener to set a second
or subsequent message listener. The Jakarta Messaging provider will be responsible for
ensuring that a second message listener may be safely configured even if
the underlying connection has been started.

==== Transactions

A session may be optionally specified as _transacted_. Each transacted
session supports a single series of transactions. Each transaction
groups a set of produced messages and a set of consumed messages into an
atomic unit of work. In effect, transactions organize a session’s input
message stream and output message stream into a series of atomic units.
When a transaction commits, its atomic unit of input is acknowledged and
its associated atomic unit of output is sent. If a transaction rollback
is done, its produced messages are destroyed and its consumed messages
are automatically recovered. For more information on session recovery
see Section 6.2.10 “Message acknowledgment”.

A transaction is completed using either its session’s commit() or
rollback() method. The completion of a session’s current transaction
automatically begins the next. The result is that a transacted session
always has a current transaction within which its work is done.

JTS or some other transaction monitor facility may be used to combine a
session’s transaction with transactions on other resources (databases,
other Jakarta Messaging Sessions, etc.). Since Java distributed transactions are
controlled via the Jakarta Transactions transaction demarcation API, use of the session’s
commit and rollback methods in this context throws a Jakarta Messaging
TransactionInProgressException.

==== Distributed transactions

Jakarta Messaging does not require that a provider support distributed transactions;
however, it does define that if a provider supplies this support it
should be done via the Java XAResource API.

A Jakarta Messaging provider may also be a distributed transaction monitor. If it is,
it should provide control of the transaction via the Jakarta Transactions API.

Although it is possible for a Jakarta Messaging client to handle distributed
transactions directly, it is recommended that Jakarta Messaging clients avoid doing
this. Jakarta Messaging clients that use the XA-based interfaces described in Chapter
11 “Jakarta Messaging application server facilities” may not be portable across
different Jakarta Messaging implementations, because these interfaces are optional.
Support for Jakarta Transactions in Jakarta Messaging is targeted at systems vendors who will be
integrating Jakarta Messaging into their application server products. See Chapter 11
“Jakarta Messaging application server facilities” for more information.

==== Message order

Jakarta Messaging clients need to understand when they can depend on message order and
when they cannot.

===== Order of message receipt

Messages consumed by a session define a serial order. This order is
important because it defines the effect of message acknowledgment. See
Section 6.2.10 “Message acknowledgment” for more details. The messages
for each of a session’s consumers are interleaved in a session’s input
message stream.

Jakarta Messaging defines that messages sent by a session to a destination must be
received in the order in which they were sent (see Section 6.2.9.2
“Order of message sends” for a few qualifications). This defines a
partial ordering constraint on a session’s input message stream.

Jakarta Messaging does not define order of message receipt across destinations or
across a destination’s messages sent from multiple sessions. This aspect
of a session’s input message stream order is timing-dependent. It is not
under application control.

===== Order of message sends

Although clients loosely view the messages they produce within a session
as forming a serial stream of sent messages, the total ordering of this
stream is not significant. The only ordering that is visible to
receiving clients is the order of messages a session sends to a
particular destination. Several things can affect this order:

* Messages of higher priority may jump ahead of previous lower-priority
messages.
* Messages with a later delivery time may be delivered after messages
with an earlier delivery time.
* A client may not receive a NON_PERSISTENT message due to a Jakarta Messaging
provider failure.
* If both PERSISTENT and NON_PERSISTENT messages are sent to a
destination, order is only guaranteed within delivery mode. That is, a
later NON_PERSISTENT message may arrive ahead of an earlier PERSISTENT
message; however, it will never arrive ahead of an earlier
NON_PERSISTENT message with the same priority.
* A client may use a transacted session to group its sent messages into
atomic units (the producer component of a Jakarta Messaging transaction). A
transaction’s order of messages to a particular destination is
significant. The order of sent messages across destinations is not
significant. See Section 6.2.7 “Transactions” for more information.

==== Message acknowledgment

If a session is transacted, message acknowledgment is handled
automatically by commit__,__ and recovery is handled automatically by
rollback.

If a session is not transacted, there are three acknowledgment options
and recovery is handled manually:

* DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE - This option instructs the session to lazily
acknowledge the delivery of messages. This is likely to result in the
delivery of some duplicate messages if Jakarta Messaging fails. It it should therefore
only be used by consumers that are tolerant of duplicate messages. Its
benefit is the reduction of session overhead achieved by minimizing the
work the session does to prevent duplicates.
* AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE - With this option, the session automatically
acknowledges a client’s receipt of a message when it has either
successfully returned from a call to receive or the message listener it
has called to process the message successfully returns.
* CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE - With this option, a client acknowledges a message
by calling the message’s acknowledge method. Acknowledging a consumed
message automatically acknowledges the receipt of all messages that have
been delivered by its session.

When CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE mode is used, a client may build up a large
number of unacknowledged messages while attempting to process them. A
Jakarta Messaging provider should provide administrators with a way to limit client
over-run so that clients are not driven to resource exhaustion and
ensuing failure when some resource they are using is temporarily
blocked.

A session’s recover method is used to stop a session and restart it with
its first unacknowledged message. In effect, the session’s series of
delivered messages is reset to the point after its last acknowledged
message. The messages it now delivers may be different from those that
were originally delivered due to message expiration, the arrival of
higher-priority messages, or the delivery of messages which could not
previously be delivered as they had not reached their specified delivery
time.

A session must set the JMSRedelivered header and increment the
JMSXDeliveryCount property of messages it redelivers due to a recovery.

==== Duplicate delivery of messages

A Jakarta Messaging provider must never deliver a second copy of an acknowledged
message.

When a client uses the AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE mode, it is not in direct
control of message acknowledgment. Since such clients cannot know for
certain if a particular message has been acknowledged, they must be
prepared for redelivery of the last consumed message. This can be caused
by the client completing its work just prior to a failure that prevents
the message acknowledgment from occurring. Only a session’s last
consumed message is subject to this ambiguity. The JMSRedelivered
message header field must be set for a message redelivered under these
circumstances, and the JMSXDeliveryCount property must be incremented.

==== Duplicate production of messages

Jakarta Messaging providers must never produce duplicate messages. This means that a
client that produces a message can rely on its Jakarta Messaging provider to ensure
that consumers of the message will receive it only once. No client error
can cause a provider to duplicate a message.

If a failure occurs between the time a client commits its work on a
Session and the commit method returns, the client cannot determine if
the transaction was committed or rolled back. The same ambiguity exists
when a failure occurs between the non-transactional send of a PERSISTENT
message and the return from the sending method.

It is up to a Jakarta Messaging application to deal with this ambiguity. In some
cases, this may cause a client to produce functionally duplicate
messages.

A message that is redelivered due to session recovery is not considered
a duplicate message.

==== Serial execution of client code

Even though the Java language provides built-in support for
multithreading, writing multithreaded programs is still more difficult
than writing single-threaded ones.

For this reason, Jakarta Messaging does not cause concurrent execution of client code
unless a client explicitly requests it. One way this is done is to
define that a session serializes all asynchronous delivery of messages.

To receive messages asynchronously, a client creates a consumer object
(MessageConsumer, JMSConsumer, QueueReceiver or TopicConsumer) and uses
the setMessageListener method to register with it an object that
implements the Jakarta Messaging MessageListener interface. _In effect, a session uses
a single thread to run all its message listeners_. While the thread is
busy executing one listener, all other messages to be asynchronously
delivered to the session must wait.

==== Concurrent message delivery

Clients that desire concurrent delivery can use multiple sessions. In
effect, each session’s listener thread runs concurrently. While a
listener on one session is executing, a listener on another session may
also be executing.

==== Closing a session

Since a provider may allocate some resources on behalf of a session
outside the JVM, clients should close a session when it is not needed.
Relying on garbage collection to eventually reclaim these resources may
not be timely enough. The same is true for any producer and consumer
objects created by a session.

The close methods on Session, QueueSession and TopicSession allow a
session to be closed separately from the connection used to create it.

The close method on JMSContext closes the underlying session. If there
are no other active (not closed) JMSContext objects using the underlying
connection then it also closes the underlying connection.

Session close terminates all message processing on the session. It must
handle the shutdown of pending receives by the session’s consumers or a
running message listener as described in section 6.1.8 “Closing a
connection”.

Session close is the only session method that may be invoked from a
thread of control separate from the one which is currently controlling
the session.

When session close is invoked it should not return until its message
processing has been shut down in an orderly fashion. This means that
none of its message listeners are running, and that if there is a
pending receive, it has returned with either null or a message.

If a message listener attempts to close its own session (either by
calling +
close on a Session object or by calling close on a JMSContext object) +
then it will either fail and throw a jakarta.jms.IllegalStateException (in
the case of Session) or jakarta.jms.IllegalStateRuntimeException (in the
case of JMSContext), or it will succeed and close the session, blocking
until any pending receive call in progress has completed. If close
succeeds and the acknowledge mode of the session is set to
AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE, the current message will still be acknowledged
automatically when the onMessage call completes.

Since two alternative behaviors are permitted in this case, applications
should avoid calling close from a message listener on its own Session or
JMSContext because this is not portable.

When a session is closed, there is no need to close its constituent
producers, consumers or queue browsers. The session close is sufficient
to signal the Jakarta Messaging provider that all resources for the session should be
released.

Note that closing a connection will cause any sessions created from it
to be closed, so, although a session should be closed when no longer
needed, there is no need to close a session immediately prior to closing
its connection.

The Session, JMSContext, QueueSession and TopicSession interfaces all
extend the java.lang.AutoCloseable interface. This means that
applications which create these objects in a try-with-resources
statement do not need to call the close method when they no longer
needed. Instead these objects will be closed automatically at the end of
the statement. The use of a try-with-resources statement also simplifies
the handling of any exceptions thrown by the close method.

Closing a transacted session must rollback its transaction in progress.
Closing a client-acknowledged session does NOT force an acknowledge.

Once a session has been closed, an attempt to use it or its consumers
and producers must throw an IllegalStateException (calls to the close
method of these objects must be ignored). It is valid to continue to use
message objects created or received via the session with the exception
of a received message’s acknowledge method.

Closing a closed session must NOT throw an exception.

== Sending messages

=== Producers

A client application uses a _producer_ to send messages to a
Destination.

* In the classic API a producer is represented by a MessageProducer
object and is created using the method createProducer(Destination
destination)on Session. The destination parameter specifies the
destination to which the producer will send messages.
+
If destination is set to null then the destination must be specified on
every send operation. A typical use for this style of producer is to
send replies to requests using the request’s JMSReplyTo destination.
* In the simplified API a producer is represented by a JMSProducer
object and is created using the method createProducer() on JMSContext.
The destination must be specified on every send operation.
* In the domain-specific API for point-to-point messaging a producer is
represented by a QueueSender object and is created using the method
createSender(Queue queue) on QueueSession. The queue parameter specifies
the queue to which the producer will send messages. If queue is set to
null then the queue must be specified on every send operation.
* In the domain-specified API for pub-sub messaging a producer is
represented by a TopicPublisher object and is created using the method
createPublisher(Topic topic)on TopicSession. The topic parameter
specifies the topic to which the producer will send messages. If topic
is set to null then the topic must be specified on every send operation.

A producer may be used to send a message either synchronously or
asynchronously. For more details see sections 7.2 “Synchronous send” and
7.3 “Asynchronous send”.

Each time a client creates a producer, it defines a new sequence of
messages that have no ordering relationship with the messages it has
previously sent.

=== Synchronous send

* In the classic API the following methods on MessageProducer may be
used to send a message synchronously:
+
----
send(Message message)

send(Message message, int deliveryMode, int priority, long timeToLive)

send(Destination destination, Message message, int deliveryMode, int
priority, long timeToLive)

send(Destination destination, Message message)
----

* In the simplified API the following method on JMSProducer may be used
to send a message:
+
----
send(Destination destination, Message message)
----
+
The following methods on JMSProducer allow the application to supply the
message body directly. The Jakarta Messaging provider automatically creates a message of the appropriate type before sending.
+
----
send(Destination destination, String body)

send(Destination destination, Map<String,Object> body)

send(Destination destination, byte[] body)

send(Destination destination, Serializable body)

send(Destination destination, String body)
----
+
All the send method on JMSProducer will send the message synchronously
unless the JMSProducer has been configured to perform an asynchronous
send.


* In the domain-specific API for point-to-point messaging the following
methods on QueueSender may be used to send a message synchronously:
+
----
send(Message message)

send(Message message, int deliveryMode, int priority, long timeToLive)

send(Queue queue, Message message)

send(Queue queue, Message message, int deliveryMode, int priority, long
timeToLive)
----
+
These are in addition to the methods inherited from MessageProducer and
listed above.

* In the domain-specific API for pub/sub messaging the following methods
on TopicPublisher may be used to send a message synchronously:
+
----
publish(Message message)

publish(Message message, int deliveryMode, int priority, long
timeToLive)

publish(Topic topic, Message message)

publish(Topic topic, Message message, int deliveryMode, int priority,
long timeToLive)
----
+
These are in addition to the methods inherited from MessageProducer and
listed above.

These methods will block until the message has been sent. If necessary
the call will block until a confirmation message has been received back
from the Jakarta Messaging server.

=== Asynchronous send

Clients may alternatively send a message asynchronously. This permits
the Jakarta Messaging provider to perform part of the work involved in sending the
message in a separate thread.

* In the classic API the following methods on MessageProducer may be
used to send a message asynchronously
+
----
send(Message message, CompletionListener completionListener)

send(Message message, int deliveryMode, int priority, long timeToLive,
CompletionListener completionListener)

send(Destination destination, Message message, CompletionListener
completionListener)

send(Destination destination, Message message, int deliveryMode, int
priority, long timeToLive, CompletionListener completionListener)
----

* In the simplified API a JMSProducer may be used to send a message
asynchronously by using calling the method `setAsync(CompletionListener
completionListener)` on the JMSProducer prior to calling one of the
normal send methods listed in section 7.2 “Synchronous send”.

* In the domain-specific API for point-to-point messaging a QueueSender
may be used to send a message asynchronously using any of the methods
inherited from MessageProducer and listed above.

* In the domain-specific API for pub/sub messaging a TopicPublisher may
be used to send a message asynchronously using any of the methods
inherited from MessageProducer and listed above.

When the message has been successfully sent the Jakarta Messaging provider invokes the callback method onCompletion on an application-specified
CompletionListener object. Only when that callback has been invoked can
the application be sure that the message has been successfully sent with
the same degree of confidence as if a normal synchronous send had been
performed. An application which requires this degree of confidence must
therefore wait for the callback to be invoked before continuing.

The following information is intended to give an indication of how an
asynchronous send would typically be implemented.

In some Jakarta Messaging providers, a normal synchronous send involves sending the
message to a remote Jakarta Messaging server and then waiting for an acknowledgement
to be received before returning. It is expected that such a provider
would implement an asynchronous send by sending the message to the
remote Jakarta Messaging server and then returning without waiting for an
acknowledgement. When the acknowledgement is received, the Jakarta Messaging provider
would notify the application by invoking the onCompletion method on the
application-specified CompletionListener object. If for some reason the
acknowledgement is not received the Jakarta Messaging provider would notify the
application by invoking the CompletionListener’s onException method.

In those cases where the Jakarta Messaging specification permits a lower level of
reliability, a normal synchronous send might not wait for an
acknowledgement. In that case it is expected that an asynchronous send
would be similar to a synchronous send: the Jakarta Messaging provider would send the
message to the remote Jakarta Messaging server and then return without waiting for an
acknowledgement. However the Jakarta Messaging provider would still notify the
application that the send had completed by invoking the onCompletion
method on the application-specified CompletionListener object.

It is up to the Jakarta Messaging provider to decide exactly what is performed in the
calling thread and what, if anything, is performed asynchronously, so
long as it satisfies the requirements given in the following sections:

==== Quality of service

After the send operation has completed successfully, which means that
the message has been successfully sent with the same degree of
confidence as if a normal synchronous send had been performed, the Jakarta Messaging
provider must invoke the CompletionListener’s onCompletion method.The
CompletionListener must not be invoked earlier than this.

==== Exceptions

If an exception is encountered during the call to the send method then
an appropriate exception should be thrown in the thread that is calling
the send method. In this case the Jakarta Messaging provider must not invoke the
CompletionListener’s onCompletion or onException method.

If an exception is encountered which cannot be thrown in the thread that
is calling the send method then the Jakarta Messaging provider must call the
CompletionListener’s onException method.

In both cases if an exception occurs it is undefined whether or not the
message was successfully sent.

==== Message order

If the same producer is used to send multiple messages then Jakarta Messaging message
ordering requirements (see section 6.2.9 “Message order”) must be
satisfied. This applies even if a combination of synchronous and
asynchronous sends has been performed. The application is not required
to wait for an asynchronous send to complete before sending the next
message.

==== Close, commit or rollback

If the application calls close to close the producer, session or
connection then the Jakarta Messaging provider must block until any incomplete send
operations have been completed and all CompletionListener callbacks have
returned before closing the object and returning.

If the session is transacted (uses a local transaction) then when the
commit or rollback method is called the Jakarta Messaging provider must block until
any incomplete send operations have been completed and all
CompletionListener callbacks have returned before performing the commit
or rollback.

Incomplete sends should be allowed to complete normally unless an error
occurs.

A CompletionListener callback method must not call close on its own
producer, session (including JMSContext) or connection or call commit or
rollback on its own session. Doing so will cause the close, commit or
rollback to throw an IllegalStateException or
IllegalStateRuntimeException (depending on the method signature).

==== Restrictions on usage in Jakarta EE

An asynchronous send is not permitted in a Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container.

The following methods must therefore not be used in a Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container:

* jakarta.jms.MessageProducer method send(Message message,
CompletionListener completionListener)
* jakarta.jms.MessageProducer method send(Message message, int
deliveryMode, int priority, long timeToLive, CompletionListener
completionListener)
* jakarta.jms.MessageProducer method send(Destination destination, Message
message, CompletionListener completionListener)
* jakarta.jms.MessageProducer method send(Destination destination, Message
message, int deliveryMode, int priority, long timeToLive,
CompletionListener completionListener)
* jakarta.jms.JMSProducer method setAsync(CompletionListener
completionListener)

All the methods listed in this section may throw a
jakarta.jms.JMSException (if allowed by the method) or a
jakarta.jms.JMSRuntimeException (if not) when called by an application
running in the Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container. This is recommended but not
required.

==== Message headers

Jakarta Messaging defines a number of message header fields and message properties
which must be set by the “Jakarta Messaging provider on send”. See section 3.4.11 “How
message header values are set” and section 3.5.9 “Jakarta Messaging defined
properties”. If the send is asynchronous these fields and properties may
be accessed on the sending client only after the CompletionListener has
been invoked. If the CompletionListener’s onException method is called
then the state of these message header fields and properties is
undefined. See also section 7.3.9 “Restrictions on the use of the
Message object” below.

==== Restrictions on threading 

Applications that perform an asynchronous send must conform to the
threading restrictions defined in section 6.2.5 “Threading restrictions
on a session”. This means that the session may be used by only one
thread at a time.

Setting a CompletionListener does not cause the session to be dedicated
to the thread of control which calls the CompletionListener. The
application thread may therefore continue to use the session after
performing an asynchronous send. However the CompletionListener’s
callback methods must not use the session if an application thread might
be using the session at the same time.

==== Use of the CompletionListener by the Jakarta Messaging provider

A session will only invoke one CompletionListener callback method at a
time. For a given MessageProducer or JMSContext, callbacks (both
onCompletion and onException) will be performed in the same order as the
corresponding calls to the asynchronous send method.

A Jakarta Messaging provider must not invoke the CompletionListener from the thread
that is calling the asynchronous send method.

==== Restrictions on the use of the Message object

Applications which perform an asynchronous send must take account of the
restriction that a Message object is designed to be accessed by one
logical thread of control at a time and does not support concurrent use.
See section 2.14 “Multi-threading”.

After the send method has returned, the application must not attempt to
read the headers, properties or body of the Message object until the
CompletionListener’s onCompletion or onException method has been called.
This is because the Jakarta Messaging provider may be modifying the Message object in
another thread during this time.

A Jakarta Messaging provider may throw a JMSException if the application attempts to
access or modify the Message object after the send method has returned
and before the CompletionListener has been invoked. If the Jakarta Messaging provider
does not throw an exception then the behaviour is undefined.

=== Setting message delivery options

A client can specify a producer’s delivery mode, priority, time-to-live
and delivery delay. This sets these values for all messages sent by a
producer,

An application that uses the classic or domain-specific APIs may also
specify the delivery mode, priority, and time-to-live as parameters to
the send method used to send the message. This overrides any values set
on the producer itself.

For more information on these various options see sections 7.7 “Message
delivery mode”, Section “", 7.8 “Message time-to-live” and 7.9 “Message
delivery delay”.

=== Setting message properties

Prior to sending a message, the client application may use methods on
the `Message` object to set message properties.

Applications using the simplified API may also set message properties on
the JMSProducer. There are nine methods on JMSProducer, all called
setProperty. Any message properties set using these methods will
override any values that have been set directly on the message.

There are five send methods on JMSProducer that allow the application to
supply the message body directly without the need to create a Message
object. When these methods are used the JMSProducer’s setProperty
methods provide the only way to set message properties.

There are five send methods on JMSProducer that allow the application to
supply the message body directly without the need to create a Message
object. When these methods are used the only way to set message
properties is to call setProperty on JMSProducer prior to calling send.

=== Setting message headers

Prior to sending a message, the application may use methods on the
Message object to set the JMSCorrelationID, JMSReplyTo and JMSType
message headers.

For more information see sections 3.4.5 “JMSCorrelationID” 3.4.6
“JMSReplyTo” and 3.4.8 “JMSType” above.

Applications using the simplified API may also set these message headers
on the JMSProducer. Any message headers set using these methods will
override any values that have been set directly on the message.

There are five send methods on JMSProducer that allow the application to
supply the message body directly without the need to create a Message
object. When these methods are used the only way to set these message
headers is to call the appropriate methods on JMSProducer prior to
calling send.

=== Message delivery mode

Jakarta Messaging supports two modes of message delivery.

* The NON_PERSISTENT mode is the lowest overhead delivery mode because
it does not require that the message be logged to stable storage. A Jakarta Messaging
provider failure can cause a NON_PERSISTENT message to be lost.
* The PERSISTENT mode instructs the Jakarta Messaging provider to take extra care to
ensure the message is not lost in transit due to a Jakarta Messaging provider failure.

A Jakarta Messaging provider must deliver a NON_PERSISTENT message _at-most-once._
This means it may lose the message, but it must not deliver it twice.

A Jakarta Messaging provider must deliver a PERSISTENT message _once-and-only-once_.
This means a Jakarta Messaging provider failure must not cause it to be lost, and it
must not deliver it twice.

PERSISTENT (once-and-only-once) and NON_PERSISTENT (at-most-once)
message delivery are a way for a Jakarta Messaging client to select between delivery
techniques that may lose a messages if a Jakarta Messaging provider dies and those
which take extra effort to ensure that messages can survive such a
failure. There is typically a performance/reliability trade-off implied
by this choice. When a client selects the NON_PERSISTENT delivery mode,
it is indicating that it values performance over reliability; a
selection of PERSISTENT reverses the requested trade-off.

_The use of PERSISTENT messages does not guarantee that all messages are
always delivered to every eligible consumer._ See Section 9.1
“Reliability” for further discussion on this topic.

An application may specify the required delivery mode using the method
setDeliveryMode on the producer object. This sets the delivery mode of
all messages sent using that producer. An application that uses the
classic or domain-specific APIs may also specify the delivery mode as a
parameter to the send method used to send the message. Note however that
the setDeliveryMode method on Message cannot be used to set the delivery
mode of a message.

See also section 3.4.2 “JMSDeliveryMode”.

=== Message time-to-live

A client can specify a time-to-live value in milliseconds for each
message it sends. This is used to determine the message’s expiration
time which is calculated by adding the time-to-live value specified on
the send method to the time the message was sent (for transacted sends,
this is the time the client sends the message, not the time the
transaction is committed).

A Jakarta Messaging provider should do its best to accurately expire messages;
however, Jakarta Messaging does not define the accuracy provided. It is not acceptable
to simply ignore time-to-live.

An application may specify the required time-to-live using the method
setTimeToLive on the producer object. This sets the time-to-live of all
messages sent using that producer. An application that uses the classic
or domain-specific APIs may also specify the time-to-live as a parameter
to the send method used to send the message. Note however that the
setTimeToLive method on Message cannot be used to set the time-to-live
of a message.

See also section 3.4.9 “JMSExpiration”.

=== Message delivery delay

A client can specify a delivery delay value in milliseconds for each
message it sends. This is used to determine the message’s delivery time
which is calculated by adding the delivery delay value specified on the
send method to the time the message was sent (for transacted sends, this
is the time the client sends the message, not the time the transaction
is committed).

A message’s delivery time is the earliest time when a Jakarta Messaging provider may
deliver the message to a consumer. The provider must not deliver
messages before the delivery time has been reached.

If a message is published to a topic, it will only be added to a durable
or non-durable subscription on that topic if the subscription exists at
the time the message is sent.

An application may specify the required delivery delay using the method
setDeliveryDelay on the producer object. This sets the delivery delay of
all messages sent using that producer. Note however that the
setDeliveryDelay method on Message cannot be used to set the delivery
delay of a message.

See also section 3.4.13 “JMSDeliveryTime”.

=== JMSProducer method chaining

In the simplified API, the various setter methods on JMSProducer all
return the JMSProducer object. This allows method calls to be chained
together, allowing a fluid programming style. For example:

----
context.createProducer().
    setProperty("foo", "bar").
    setTimeToLive(10000).
    setDeliveryMode(NON_PERSISTENT).
    setDisableMessageTimestamp(true).
    send(dataQueue, body);
----

Instances of JMSProducer are intended to be lightweight objects which
can be created freely and which do not consume significant resources.
JMSProducer therefore does not provide a close method.

== Receiving messages

=== Consumers

A client uses a _consumer_ to receive messages from a destination.

* In the classic API a consumer is represented by a MessageConsumer
object and is created using one of several methods on Session.
* In the simplified API a consumer is represented by a JMSConsumer
object and is created using one of several methods on JMSContext.
* In the domain-specific API for point-to-point messaging a consumer is
represented by a QueueReceiver object and is created using one of
several methods on QueueSession.
* In the domain-specified API for pub-sub messaging a consumer is
represented by a TopicSubscriber object and is created using one of
several methods on TopicSession.
+
In all cases the destination from which the consumer will receive
messages must be specified.
+
The methods used to create a consumer are described in sections 8.2
“Creating a consumer on a queue” and 8.3 “Creating a consumer on a
topic” below.

A consumer can be created with a message selector. This allows the
client to restrict the messages delivered to the consumer to those that
match the selector. See Section 3.8.1 “Message selector” for more information.

A client may either synchronously receive a consumer’s messages or have
the provider asynchronously deliver them as they arrive. See sections
8.5 “Receiving messages synchronously”, 8.6 “Receiving message bodies
synchronously” and 8.7 “Receiving messages asynchronously” below.

=== Creating a consumer on a queue

The methods used to create a consumer on a queue vary depending on which
API is being used. The basic semantics of queues were introduced in
section 4.1.2 “Queue semantics”.

* In the classic API a consumer on a queue is created using one of
several createConsumer methods on Session, all of which return a
MessageConsumer.
* In the simplified API a consumer on a queue is created using one of
several createConsumer methods on JMSContext, all of which return a
JMSConsumer.
* In the domain-specific API for point-to-point messaging a consumer on
a queue is created using one of several createReceiver methods on
QueueSession, all of which return a QueueReceiver:

=== Creating a consumer on a topic

The methods used to create a consumer on a topic vary depending on what
kind of topic subscription is required, and which API is being used. The
basic concepts of topics were introduced in section 4.2.2 “Topic
semantics” and are explained in more detail below.

==== Unshared non-durable subscriptions

An unshared non-durable subscription is the simplest way to consume
messages from a topic.

An unshared non-durable subscription is created, and a consumer object
created on that subscription, using one of the following methods:

* In the classic API, one of several createConsumer methods on Session.
These return a MessageConsumer object.
* In the simplified API, one of several createConsumer methods on
JMSContext. These return a JMSConsumer object.
* In the legacy domain-specific API for pub/sub, using one of several
createSubscriber methods on TopicSession. These return a TopicSubscriber
object.
* In the legacy domain-specific API for pub/sub, using one of several
createConsumer methods on TopicSession. As these methods are inherited
from Session they return a MessageConsumer object.

An unshared non-durable subscription does not have a name. Each call to
createConsumer or createSubscriber creates a new subscription.

An unshared non-durable subscription only exists for as long as the
consumer remains active. This means that any messages sent to the topic
will only be added to the subscription for as long as the consumer
object exists and is not closed. The subscription is not persisted and
will be deleted (together with any undelivered messages associated with
it) when the consumer is closed.

If a message selector is specified then only messages with properties
matching the message selector expression will be added to the
subscription.

The noLocal parameter may be used to specify that messages published to
the topic by its own connection must not be added to the subscription.

Each unshared non-durable subscription has a single consumer. If the
application needs to create multiple consumers on the same subscription
then a shared non-durable subscription should be used instead. See
section 8.3.2 “Shared non-durable subscriptions”.

If the application needs to be able to receive messages that were sent
to the topic even when there was no active consumer on it then a durable
subscription should be used instead. See section 8.3.3 “Unshared durable
subscriptions”.

==== Shared non-durable subscriptions

A non-durable shared subscription is used by a client that needs to be
able to share the work of receiving messages from a non-durable topic
subscription amongst multiple consumers. A non-durable shared
subscription may therefore have more than one consumer. Each message
from the subscription will be delivered to only one of the consumers on
that subscription.

A shared non-durable subscription is created, and a consumer created on
that subscription, using one of the following methods:

* In the classic API, one of several createSharedConsumer methods on
Session. These return a MessageConsumer object.
* In the simplified API, one of several createSharedConsumer methods on
JMSContext. These return a JMSConsumer object.
* In the legacy domain-specific API for pub/sub, using one of several
createSharedConsumer methods on TopicSession. As these methods are
inherited from Session they return a MessageConsumer object.

The same methods may be used to create a consumer on an existing shared
non-durable subscription.

A shared non-durable subscription is identified by a name specified by
the client and by the client identifier if set. If the client identifier
was set when the shared non-durable subscription was first created then
a client which subsequently wishes to create a consumer on that shared
non-durable subscription must use the same client identifier.

A shared non-durable subscription only exists for as long as there is an
active consumer on the subscription. This means that any messages sent
to the topic will only be added to the subscription whilst a consumer
object exists and is not closed. The subscription is not persisted and
will be deleted (together with any undelivered messages associated with
it) when the last consumer on the subscription is closed.

If there is an active (i.e. not closed) consumer on the shared
non-durable subscription, and an attempt is made to create an additional
consumer, specifying the same name and client identifier (if set) but a
different topic or message selector, then a JMSException or
JMSRuntimeException (depending on the method signature) will be thrown.

If a message selector is specified then only messages with properties
matching the message selector expression will be added to the
subscription.

There is no restriction to prevent a shared non-durable subscription and
a durable subscription having the same name. Such subscriptions would be
completely separate.

See also section 6.1.2 “Client identifier”.

==== Unshared durable subscriptions

A durable subscription is used by an application that needs to receive
all the messages published on a topic, including the ones published when
there is no consumer associated with it. The Jakarta Messaging provider retains a
record of this durable subscription and ensures that all messages from
the topic’s publishers are retained until they are delivered to, and
acknowledged by, a consumer on the durable subscription or until they
have expired.

An _unshared_ durable subscription may have only one active (i.e. not
closed) consumer at the same time.

An unshared durable subscription is created, and a consumer created on
that subscription, using one of the following methods:

* In the classic API, one of several createDurableConsumer methods on
Session. These return a MessageConsumer object.
* In the simplified API, one of several createDurableConsumer methods on
JMSContext. These return a JMSConsumer object.
* In the legacy domain-specific API for pub/sub, one of several
createDurableSubscriber methods on Session and TopicSession. These
return a TopicSubscriber object.

The same methods may be used to create a consumer on an existing
unshared durable subscription.

An unshared durable subscription is identified by a name specified by
the client and by the client identifier, which must be set. A client
which subsequently wishes to create a consumer on that unshared durable
subscription must use the same client identifier.

An unshared durable subscription is persisted and will continue to
accumulate messages until it is deleted using the unsubscribe method on
the Session, JMSContext or TopicSession. It is erroneous for a client to
delete a durable subscription while it has an active consumer or while a
message received from it is part of a current transaction or has not
been acknowledged in the session.

If there is an active (i.e. not closed) consumer on the unshared durable
subscription, and an attempt is made to create an additional consumer,
specifying the same name and client identifier, then a JMSException or
JMSRuntimeException (depending on the method signature) will be thrown.

If there is no active (i.e. not closed) consumer on the unshared durable
subscription, and an attempt is made to create a new consumer on that
unshared durable subscription, specifying the same name and client
identifier but a different topic, message selector or noLocal value,
then this is equivalent to unsubscribing (deleting) the old one and
creating a new one.

A shared durable subscription and an unshared durable subscription may
not have the same name and client identifier. If the application calls
one of the createDurableConsumer or createDurableSubscriber methods, and
a shared durable subscription already exists with the same name and
client identifier, then a JMSException or JMSRuntimeException (depending
on the method signature) will be thrown.

If a message selector is specified then only messages with properties
matching the message selector expression will be added to the
subscription.

The noLocal parameter may be used to specify that messages published to
the topic by the Session, JMSContext or TopicSession’s own connection,
or any other connection with the same client identifier, will not be
added to the durable subscription.

There is no restriction to prevent a durable subscription and a shared
non-durable subscription having the same name. Such subscriptions would
be completely separate.

See also section 6.1.2 “Client identifier”.

==== Shared durable subscriptions

A durable subscription is used by an application that needs to receive
all the messages published on a topic, including the ones published when
there is no consumer associated with it. The Jakarta Messaging provider retains a
record of this durable subscription and ensures that all messages from
the topic’s publishers are retained until they are delivered to, and
acknowledged by, a consumer on the durable subscription or until they
have expired.

A _shared_ non-durable subscription is used by a client that needs to be
able to share the work of receiving messages from a durable subscription
amongst multiple consumers. A shared durable subscription may therefore
have more than one consumer. Each message from the subscription will be
delivered to only one of the consumers on that subscription.

A shared durable subscription is created, and a consumer created on that
subscription, using one of the following methods:

* In the classic API, one of several createSharedDurableConsumer methods
on Session. These return a MessageConsumer object.
* In the simplified API, one of several createSharedDurableConsumer
methods on JMSContext. These return a JMSConsumer object.
* In the legacy domain-specific API for pub/sub, using one of several
createSharedDurableConsumer methods on JMSContext return a JMSConsumer.

The same methods may be used to create a consumer on an existing shared
durable subscription.

A shared durable subscription is identified by a name specified by the
client and by the client identifier if set. If the client identifier was
set when the shared durable subscription was first created then a client
which subsequently wishes to create a consumer on that shared durable
subscription must use the same client identifier.

A durable subscription is persisted and will continue to accumulate
messages until it is deleted using the unsubscribe method on the
Session, TopicSession or JMSContext. It is erroneous for a client to
delete a durable subscription while it has an active consumer or while a
message received from it is part of a current transaction or has not
been acknowledged in the session.

If there are no active (i.e. not closed) consumers on the shared durable
subscription, and an attempt is made to create a new consumer,
specifying the same name and client identifier (if set) but a different
topic or message selector, then this is equivalent to unsubscribing
(deleting) the old one and creating a new one.

If there is an active (i.e. not closed) consumer on the shared durable
subscription, and an attempt is made to create an additional consumer,
specifying the same name and client identifier (if set) but a different
topic or message selector, then a JMSException or JMSRuntimeException
(depending on the method signature) will be thrown.

A shared durable subscription and an unshared durable subscription may
not have the same name and client identifier. If the application calls
one of the createSharedDurableConsumer methods, and an unshared durable
subscription already exists with the same name and client identifier,
then a JMSException or JMSRuntimeException is thrown.

If a message selector is specified then only messages with properties
matching the message selector expression will be added to the
subscription.

There is no restriction to prevent a durable subscription and a shared
non-durable subscription having the same name. Such subscriptions would
be completely separate.

See also section 6.1.2 “Client identifier”.

=== Starting message delivery

An application using the classic API to consume messages needs to call
the connection’s start method to start delivery of incoming messages. It
may temporarily suspend delivery by calling stop, after which a call to
start will restart delivery. This is described in section 6.1.3
“Connection setup”.

The simplified API provides corresponding start and stop methods on
JMSContext. The start method will be called automatically when
createConsumer or createDurableConsumer are called on the JMSContext
object. This means there is no need for the application to call start
when the consumer is first established. As with the classic API, an
application may temporarily suspend delivery by calling stop, after
which a call to start will restart delivery.

Sometimes an application will need the connection to remain in stopped
mode until setup is complete and not commence message delivery until the
start method is explicitly called, as with the classic API. This can be
configured by calling setAutoStart(false) on the JMSContext prior to
calling createConsumer or createDurableConsumer.

=== Receiving messages synchronously

A client application can request the next message from a consumer by
calling receive, receive(long timeout) or receiveNoWait methods. These
methods return a Message object.

Table 8‑1 MessageConsumer,JMSConsumer, QueueReceiver and TopicSubscriber
methods to receive a message synchronously

[cols=",",]
|===
|Message receive (); |Returns the next message produced for this
JMSConsumer
|Message receive ( +
long timeout); |Returns the next message produced for this JMSConsumer
that arrives within the specified timeout period

|Message receiveNoWait(); |Returns the next message produced for this
JMSConsumer if one is immediately available
|===

=== Receiving message bodies synchronously

A client application using the simplified API can use the following
methods on JMSConsumer to receive a message body directly.

Table 8‑2 JMSConsumer methods to receive a message body synchronously

[cols=",",]
|===
|<T> T receiveBody( +
Class<T> c); |Receives the next message produced for this JMSConsumer
and returns its body as an object of the specified type
|<T> T receiveBody( +
Class<T> c, +
long timeout); |Receives the next message produced for this JMSConsumer
that arrives within the specified timeout period, and returns its body
as an object of the specified type

|<T> T receiveBodyNoWait( +
Class<T> c); |Receives the next message produced for this JMSConsumer if
one is immediately available and returns its body as an object of the
specified type
|===

These methods may be used to receive any type of message except for
StreamMessage and Message, so long as the message has a body which is
capable of being assigned to the specified type. This means that the
specified class or interface must either be the same as, or a superclass
or superinterface of, the class of the message body. If the message is
not one of the supported types, or its body cannot be assigned to the
specified type, or it has no body, then a MessageFormatRuntimeException
is thrown.

These methods do not give access to the message headers or properties
(such as the JMSRedelivered message header field or the
JMSXDeliveryCount message property) and should only be used if the
application has no need to access them.

If the next message is expected to be a TextMessage then this should be
set to String.class or another class to which a String is assignable.

If the next message is expected to be a ObjectMessage then this should
be set to java.io.Serializable.class or another class to which the body
is assignable.

If the next message is expected to be a MapMessage then this should be
set to java.util.Map.class (or java.lang.Object).

If the next message is expected to be a BytesMessage then this should be
set to byte[].class (or java.lang.Object).

The result of this method throwing a MessageFormatRuntimeException
depends on the session mode:

* AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE: The Jakarta Messaging provider will behave
as if the unsuccessful call to receiveBody or receiveBodyNoWait had not
occurred. The message will be delivered again before any subsequent
messages.
+
This is not considered to be redelivery and does not cause the
JMSRedelivered message header field to be set or the JMSXDeliveryCount
message property to be incremented.
* CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE: The Jakarta Messaging provider will behave as if the call to
receiveBody or receiveBodyNoWait had been successful and will not
deliver the message again.
+
As with any message that is delivered with a session mode of
CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE, the message will not be acknowledged until
acknowledge is called on the JMSContext. If an application wishes to
have the failed message redelivered, it must call recover on the
JMSContext. The redelivered message’s JMSRedelivered message header
field will be set and its JMSXDeliveryCount message property will be
incremented.
* Transacted session: The Jakarta Messaging provider will behave as if the call to
receiveBody or receiveBodyNoWait had been successful and will not
deliver the message again.
+
As with any message that is delivered in a transacted session, the
transaction will remain uncommitted until the transaction is committed
or rolled back by the application. If an application wishes to have the
failed message redelivered, it must roll back the transaction. The
redelivered message’s JMSRedelivered message header field will be set
and its JMSXDeliveryCount message property will be incremented.

=== Receiving messages asynchronously

A client can register an object that implements the Jakarta Messaging MessageListener
interface with a consumer. As messages arrive for the consumer, the
provider delivers them by calling the listener’s onMessage method.

It is possible for a listener to throw a RuntimeException; however, this
is considered a client programming error. Well behaved listeners should
catch such exceptions and attempt to divert messages causing them to
some form of application-specific ‘unprocessable message’ destination.

The result of a listener throwing a RuntimeException depends on the
session’s acknowledgment mode.

* AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE - the message will be
immediately redelivered. The number of times a Jakarta Messaging provider will
redeliver the same message before giving up is provider-dependent. The
JMSRedelivered message header field will be set, and the
JMSXDeliveryCount message property incremented, for a message
redelivered under these circumstances.
* CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE - the next message for the listener is delivered.
If a client wishes to have the previous unacknowledged message
redelivered, it must manually recover the session.
* Transacted Session - the next message for the listener is delivered.
The client can either commit or roll back the session (in other words, a
RuntimeException does not automatically rollback the session).

Jakarta Messaging providers should flag clients with message listeners that are
throwing RuntimeException as possibly malfunctioning.

See Section 6.2.13 “Serial execution of client code” for information about how onMessage calls are serialized by a session.

=== Closing a consumer

The close methods on MessageConsumer, JMSConsumer, QueueReceiver and
TopicSubscriber allow a consumer to be closed separately from the
session or connection used to create it.

Closing a consumer terminates the delivery of messages to the consumer.

close is the only method on a consumer that may be invoked from a thread
of control separate from the one which is currently controlling the
session.

If close is called in one thread whilst another thread is calling
receive on the same consumer then the call to close must block until the
receive call has completed. A blocked receive call returns null when the
consumer is closed.

If close is called in one thread whilst a message listener for this
consumer is in progress in another thread then the call to close must
block until the message listener has completed.

If close is called from a message listener’s onMessage method on its own
consumer then after this method returns the onMessage method must be
allowed to complete normally.

Closing a consumer has no effect on the acknowledgement of messages
delivered to the application, or on any transaction in progress. This is
because message acknowledgement and transactions are functions of the
session, not the consumer.

* If the session mode is AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE then
any messages delivered to the application will be automatically
acknowledged as normal.
* If the session mode is CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE then any messages delivered
to the application may be acknowledged by calling acknowledge in the
normal way. It makes no difference whether this occurs before or after
the consumer is closed.
* If the session is transacted then the application may commit or
rollback the transaction as normal. It makes no difference whether this
occurs before or after the consumer is closed.

== Other Jakarta Messaging facilities

=== Reliability

Most clients should use producers that produce PERSISTENT messages. This
ensures once-and-only-once message delivery for messages delivered from
a queue or a durable subscription.

In some cases, an application may only require at-most-once message
delivery for some of its messages. This is accomplished by publishing
NON_PERSISTENT messages. These messages typically have lower overhead;
however, they may be lost if a Jakarta Messaging provider fails. Both PERSISTENT and
NON_PERSISTENT messages can be published to the same destination.

Normally, a consumer fully processes each message before acknowledging
its receipt to Jakarta Messaging. This ensures that Jakarta Messaging does not discard a partially
processed message due to machine failure, etc. A consumer accomplishes
this by using either a transacted or CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE session.
Unacknowledged messages redelivered due to system failure must have the
JMSRedelivered message header field set, and the JMSXDeliveryCount
incremented, by the Jakarta Messaging provider, as described in sections 3.4.7
“JMSRedelivered” and 3.5.11 “JMSXDeliveryCount”

If a NON_PERSISTENT message is delivered to a durable subscription or a
queue, delivery is not guaranteed if the durable subscription becomes
inactive (that is, if it has no current subscriber) or if the Jakarta Messaging
provider is shut down and later restarted.

_It is expected that important messages will be produced with a
PERSISTENT delivery mode within a transaction and will be consumed
within a transaction from a nontemporary queue or a durable
subscription._

When this is done, applications have the highest level of assurance that
a message has been properly produced, reliably delivered, and accurately
consumed. Non-transactional production and consumption can also achieve
the same level of assurance; however, this requires careful programming.

A Jakarta Messaging provider may have resource restrictions that limit the number of
messages that can be held for high-volume destinations or non-responsive
clients. If messages are dropped due to resource limits, this is usually
a serious administrative issue that needs attention. Correct functioning
of Jakarta Messaging requires that clients are responsive and that adequate resources
to service them are available.

_Once-and-only-once message delivery, as described in this
specification, has the important caveat that it does not cover message
destruction due to message expiration or other administrative
destruction criteria. It also does not cover loss due to resource
restrictions. Configuration of adequate resources and processing power
for Jakarta Messaging applications is the job of administrators, who must be aware of
their Jakarta Messaging provider’s reliability features._

NON_PERSISTENT messages, nondurable subscriptions, and temporary
destinations are by definition unreliable. A Jakarta Messaging provider shutdown or
failure will likely cause the loss of NON_PERSISTENT messages and the
loss of messages held by temporary destinations and nondurable
subscriptions. The termination of an application will likely cause the
loss of messages held by nondurable subscriptions and temporary
destinations of the application.

=== Method inheritance across messaging domains

When Jakarta Messaging 1.1 unified the domain-specific APIs for point-to-point and
pub/sub messaging into a single “unified” API (now referred to as the
“classic” API), some methods that are not appropriate to a messaging
domain became inherited by the domain-specific interfaces. For example,
the Session interface has the method createBrowser__.__ Since
TopicSession inherits from the Session interface, TopicSession inherits
the createBrowser method, though that method must not be used by a
topic, as topics do not support queue browsers. Table 9‑1outlines these
instances.

If an application attempts to call any of the methods listed, the Jakarta Messaging
provider must throw an IllegalStateException.

== Jakarta Messaging exceptions

=== Overview

This chapter provides an overview of Jakarta Messaging exception handling and defines
the standard Jakarta Messaging exceptions.

=== JMSException and JMSRuntimeException

Jakarta Messaging defines two sets of exceptions:

* JMSException is the base class for all checked exceptions
* JMSRuntimeException is the base class for all unchecked exceptions.

In general, methods on interfaces defined in Jakarta Messaging 1.1 and earlier throw
checked exceptions, whilst methods on the JMSContext, JMSProducer and
JMSConsumer interfaces that were defined for the simplified API throw
unchecked exceptions.

For those methods which throw checked exceptions, catching JMSException
provides a generic way of handling all exceptions thrown by Jakarta Messaging.

Similarly, for those methods which throw unchecked exceptions only,
catching JMSRuntimeException provides a generic way of handling all
exceptions thrown by Jakarta Messaging. The Java language does not require unchecked
exceptions to be explicitly caught by the application.

JMSException and JMSRuntimeException provide the following information:

* A provider-specific string describing the error - This string is the
standard Java exception message, and is available via getMessage().
* A provider-specific string error code
* A reference to another exception - Often a Jakarta Messaging exception will be the
result of a lower level problem. If appropriate, this lower level
exception can be linked to the Jakarta Messaging exception.

Methods which throw checked exceptions include only JMSException in
their signatures. Jakarta Messaging methods can throw any Jakarta Messaging standard exception as
well as any Jakarta Messaging provider specific exception. *The javadoc for these
methods documents only the mandatory exception cases.*

Methods which only throw unchecked exceptions do not include any
exception in their signature. The javadoc for these methods documents
the mandatory exception cases.

=== Standard exceptions

In addition to JMSException and JMSRuntimeException, Jakarta Messaging defines several
additional exceptions that standardize the reporting of basic error
conditions.

There are only a few cases where Jakarta Messaging mandates that a specific Jakarta Messaging
exception must be thrown. These cases are indicated by the words *must
be* in the exception description. *These cases are the only ones on
which client logic* should depend on a specific problem resulting in a
specific Jakarta Messaging exception being thrown.

In the remainder of cases, it is strongly suggested that Jakarta Messaging providers
use one of the standard exceptions where possible. Jakarta Messaging providers may
also derive provider-specific exceptions from these if needed.

Jakarta Messaging defines the following standard exceptions. In most cases there is a
checked exception (a subclass of JMSException) and a corresponding
unchecked exception (a subclass of JMSRuntimeException). The unchecked
version may only be thrown on those methods whose method signature does
not permit the checked version to be thrown.

* IllegalStateException and IllegalStateRuntimeException. These
exceptions are thrown when a method is invoked at an illegal or
inappropriate time or if the provider is not in an appropriate state for
the requested operation. For example, IllegalStateException *must be*
thrown if Session.commit() is called on a non-transacted session.
IllegalStateException also *must be* called when a domain inappropriate
method is called, such as calling TopicSession.createBrowser().
* JMSSecurityException and JMSSecurityRuntimeException: These exceptions
*must be* thrown when a provider rejects a user name/password submitted
by a client. They may also be thrown for any case where a security
restriction prevents a method from completing.
* InvalidClientIDException and InvalidClientIDRuntimeException: These
exceptions *must be* thrown when a client attempts to set a connection’s
client identifier to a value that is rejected by a provider.
* InvalidDestinationException and InvalidDestinationRuntimeException:
These exceptions *must be* thrown when a destination is either not
understood by a provider or is no longer valid.
* InvalidSelectorException and InvalidSelectorRuntimeException: These
exceptions *must be* thrown when a Jakarta Messaging client attempts to give a
provider a message selector with invalid syntax.
* MessageEOFException: This exception *must be* thrown when an
unexpected end of stream has been reached when a StreamMessage or
BytesMessage is being read.
* MessageFormatException and MessageFormatRuntimeException: These
exceptions *must be* thrown when a Jakarta Messaging client attempts to use a data
type not supported by a message or attempts to read data in a message as
the wrong type. They must also be thrown when equivalent type errors are
made with message property values. For example, a MessageFormatException
*must be* thrown if StreamMessage.writeObject() is given an unsupported
class or if StreamMessage.readShort() is used to read a boolean value.
These exceptions also *must be* thrown if a provider is given a type of
message it cannot accept. Note that the special case of a failure caused
by attempting to read improperly formatted String data as numeric values
must throw the java.lang.NumberFormatException.
* MessageNotReadableException: This exception *must be* thrown when a
Jakarta Messaging client attempts to read a write-only message.
* MessageNotWriteableException and MessageNotWriteableRuntimeException:
These exceptions *must be* thrown when a Jakarta Messaging client attempts to write to
a read-only message.
* ResourceAllocationException and ResourceAllocationRuntimeException:
This exception is thrown when a provider is unable to allocate the
resources required by a method. For example, this exception should be
thrown when a call to _createTopicConnection_ fails due to lack of Jakarta Messaging
provider resources.
* TransactionInProgressException and
TransactionInProgressRuntimeException: These exceptions are thrown when
an operation is invalid because a transaction is in progress. For
instance, attempting to call Session.commit() when a session is part of
a distributed transaction should throw a
TransactionInProgressException__.__
* TransactionRolledBackException and
TransactionRolledBackRuntimeException: A TransactionRolledBackException
exception *must be* thrown when a call to Session.commit() results in a
rollback of the current transaction. A
TransactionRolledBackRuntimeException *must be* thrown when a call to
JMSContext.commit() results in a rollback of the current transaction

== Jakarta Messaging application server facilities

=== Overview

This chapter describes Jakarta Messaging facilities for concurrent processing of a
subscription’s messages. It also defines how a Jakarta Messaging provider supplies Jakarta Transactions
aware sessions. These facilities are primarily intended for the use of
the Jakarta Messaging provider.

If Jakarta Messaging clients use the Jakarta Transactions aware facilities the client program may be
non-portable code, because Jakarta Messaging providers are not required to support
these interfaces.

The facilities described in this chapter are a special category of Jakarta Messaging.
They are optional and might only be supported by some Jakarta Messaging providers.

=== Concurrent processing of a subscription’s messages

Jakarta Messaging provides a special facility for creating a consumer that can
concurrently consume messages.

This facility partitions the work into three roles:

* Jakarta Messaging provider - its role is to deliver the messages.
* Application Server - its role is to create the consumer and manage the
threads used by the concurrent MessageListener objects.
* Application - its role is to define a subscription with a destination
and optionally a message selector and provide a single threaded
MessageListener class to consume its messages. An application server
will construct multiple objects of this class to concurrently consume
messages.

This facility requires the use of the classic API or the domain-specific
APIs. It is not available in the simplified API. However since this
facility is intended for use by application servers only this
restriction does not affect applications.

==== Session

The Session, QueueSession and TopicSession objects provide the following
methods for use by application servers:

* setMessageListener() and getMessageListener() - a session’s
MessageListener consumes messages that have been assigned to the session
by a ConnectionConsumer, as described in the next few paragraphs.
* run() - causes the messages assigned to its session by a
ConnectionConsumer to be serially processed by the session’s
MessageListener. When the listener returns from processing the last
message, run() returns.

An application server would typically be given a MessageListener class
that contained the single threaded code written by an application
programmer to process messages. It would also be given the destination
and message selector that specified the messages the listener was to
consume.

An application server would take care of creating the Jakarta Messaging connection,
ConnectionConsumer, and session objects it needs to handle message
processing. It would create as many MessageListener instances as it
needed and register each with its own session.

Since many listeners will need to use the services of its session, the
listener is likely to require that its session be passed to it as a
constructor parameter.

==== ServerSession

A ServerSession is an object implemented by an application server. It is
used by an application server to associate a thread with a Jakarta Messaging session.

A ServerSession implements two methods:

* getSession() - returns the ServerSession’s Jakarta Messaging session.
* start() - starts the execution of the ServerSession thread and results
in the execution of the associated Jakarta Messaging session’s run method.

==== ServerSessionPool

A ServerSessionPool is an object implemented by an application server to
provide a pool of ServerSession objects for processing the messages of a
ConnectionConsumer.

Its only method is getServerSession(). This removes a ServerSession from
the pool and gives it to the caller (which is assumed to be a
ConnectionConsumer) to use for consuming one or more messages.

Jakarta Messaging does not architect how the pool is implemented. It could be a static
pool of ServerSession objects or it could use a sophisticated algorithm
to dynamically create ServerSession objects as needed.

If the ServerSessionPool is out of ServerSession objects, the
getServerSession() method may block. If a ConnectionConsumer is blocked,
it cannot deliver new messages until a ServerSession is eventually
returned.

==== ConnectionConsumer

For application servers, the Connection, QueueConnection and
TopicConnection objects provide a special method
createConnectionConsumer for creating a ConnectionConsumer. The messages
it is to consume are specified by a destination and a message selector.
In addition, a ConnectionConsumer must be given a ServerSessionPool to
use for processing its messages. A maxMessages value is specified to
limit the number of messages a ConnectionConsumer may load at one time
into a ServerSession’s Session.

Normally, when traffic is light, a ConnectionConsumer gets a
ServerSession from its pool; loads its Session with a single message;
and, starts it. As traffic picks up, messages can back up. If this
happens, a ConnectionConsumer can load each Session with more than one
message. This reduces the thread context switches and minimizes resource
use at the expense of some serialization of a message processing.

==== How a ConnectionConsumer uses a ServerSession

A ConnectionConsumer implemented by a Jakarta Messaging provider uses a ServerSession
to process one or more messages that have arrived. It does this as
follows:

[arabic]
. It gets a ServerSession from the its ServerSessionPool
. It gets the ServerSession’s session
. It loads the session with one or more messages
. It then starts the ServerSession to consume these messages

A ConnectionConsumer for a Connection will expect to load its messages
into a Session. A ConnectionConsumer for a QueueConnection will expect
to load its messages into a QueueSession, as one for a TopicConnection
would expect to load a TopicSession.

Note that Jakarta Messaging does not architect how the ConnectionConsumer loads the
session with messages. Since both the ConnectionConsumer and session are
implemented by the same Jakarta Messaging provider, they can accomplish the load using
a private mechanism.

==== How an application server implements a ServerSession

Jakarta Messaging does not architect the implementation of a ServerSession. A typical
implementation is presented here to illustrate the concept:

[arabic]
. An app server creates a Thread for a ServerSession registering the
ServerSession’s runObject. The implementation of this runObject is
private to the app server.

[arabic, start=5]
. The ServerSession’s start method calls its Thread’s start method. As
with all Java threads, a call to start initiates execution of the
started thread and calls the thread’s runObject. The caller to
ServerSession.start (the ConnectionConsumer) and the ServerSession
runObject are now running in different threads.
. The runObject will do some housekeeping and then call its Session’s
run() method. On return, the runObject puts its ServerSession back into
its ServerSessionPool and returns. This terminates execution of the
ServerSession’s thread and the cycle starts again.

==== The result

Jakarta Messaging has defined a flexible mechanism that partitions the job of
concurrent message consumption into roles that are well suited for each
participant.

The application programmer provides a simple to write, single threaded
implementation of MessageListener.

The Jakarta Messaging provider retains control of its messages until they are
delivered to the MessageListener. This ensures it is under direct
control of message acknowledgment.

The application server is in control of setting up the
ConnectionConsumer and managing all the threads used for executing its
MessageListeners.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the three
roles and the objects they implement.

The following diagram illustrates the process a ConnectionConsumer uses
to deliver a message to a MessageListener__.__

image:7.png[image,width=356,height=418]

=== Support for distributed transactions

Some application servers provide support for grouping resource use into
a distributed transaction. To include Jakarta Messaging transactions in a distributed
transaction, an application server requires a Jakarta Transactions API
capable Jakarta Messaging provider.

==== XA connection factory

A Jakarta Messaging provider exposes its Jakarta Transactions support using XA equivalents of the
normal connection factory objects.

* For applications which use the classic or simplified APIs, a Jakarta Messaging
provider exposes its Jakarta Transactions support using a Jakarta Messaging XAConnectionFactory which
an application server uses to create XAConnection or JMSXAContext
objects.
* For applications which use the domain-specific API for point-to-point
messaging, a Jakarta Messaging provider exposes its Jakarta Transactions support using a Jakarta Messaging
XAQueueConnectionFactory which the application server uses to create
XAQueueConnection objects.
* For applications which use the domain-specific API for pub/sub
messaging, a Jakarta Messaging provider exposes its Jakarta Transactions support using a Jakarta Messaging
XATopicConnectionFactory which the application server uses to create
XATopicConnection objects.

These connection factory objects provide the same authentication options
as normal connection factory objects. They are Jakarta Messaging administered objects
just like normal connection factory objects. It is expected that
application servers will find them using JNDI.

==== XA connection

The XA connection objects extend the capability of normal connection
objects by providing the ability to create XA session objects.

* An XAConnection provides the ability to create XASession objects.
* An XAQueueConnection provides the ability to create XAQueueSession
objects.
* An XATopicConnection provides the ability to create XATopicSession
objects.

==== XA session

The XA session objects (XASession, XAQueueSession and XATopicSession)
provide access to what looks like a normal session object (a Session,
QueueSession or TopicSession) and a javax.transaction.xa.XAResource
object which controls its transaction context.

An application server controls the transactional assignment of an XA
session object by obtaining its XAResource. It uses the XAResource to
assign the session to a distributed transaction; prepare and commit work
on the transaction, and so on. A client of the application server is
given the normal session object. Behind the scenes, the application
server controls the transaction management of the underlying XA session
object.

==== XAJMSContext

XAJMSContext provides access to what looks like a normal JMSContext
object and a javax.transaction.xa.XAResource object which controls its
transaction context.

An application server controls the transactional assignment of an
XAJMSContext by obtaining its XAResource. It uses the XAResource to
assign the session to a distributed transaction; prepare and commit work
on the transaction, and so on.

A client of the application server is given the XAJMSContext’s
JMSContext. Behind the scenes, the application server controls the
transaction management of the underlying XAJMSContext.

==== XAResource

The functionality of XAResource closely resembles that defined by the
standard X/Open XA Resource interface.

An XAResource provides some fairly sophisticated facilities for
interleaving work on multiple transactions, recovering a list of
transactions in progress, and so on. A Jakarta Transactions aware Jakarta Messaging provider must fully
implement this functionality. This could be done by using the services
of a database that supports XA, or a Jakarta Messaging provider may choose to
implement this functionality from scratch.

It is important to note that a distributed transaction context does
_not_ flow with a message; that is, the receipt of the message cannot be
part of the same transaction that produced the message. This is the
fundamental difference between messaging and synchronized processing.
Message producers and consumers use an alternative approach to
reliability that is built upon a Jakarta Messaging provider’s ability to supply a
once-and-only-once message delivery guarantee.

To reiterate, the act of producing and/or consuming messages in a
Session can be transactional. The act of producing and consuming a
specific message across different sessions cannot.

=== Jakarta Messaging application server interfaces

The domain-specific APIs for point-to-point and pub/sub messaging
provide their own versions of Jakarta Transactions aware Jakarta Messaging facilities.

However the classic API provides common interfaces, which should be used
in preference to the domain-specific interfaces. These are listed as Jakarta Messaging
common interfaces in .

== Use of Jakarta Messaging API in Jakarta EE applications

=== Overview

The Jakarta EE Platform Specification
requires support for the Jakarta Messaging API as part of the full Jakarta EE platform.

The Jakarta EE platform provides a number of additional features which are
not available in the Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE). These
include the following:

* Support for distributed transactions which are demarcated either
programmatically, using methods on jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction, or
automatically by the container. These are referred to in this
specification as Jakarta transactions to distinguish them from Jakarta Messaging local
transactions.
* Support for Jakarta Messaging message-driven beans.

These features are defined in detail in other specifications including
the Jakarta EE Platform specification and the Jakarta Enterprise Beans
specification. However the use of the Jakarta EE platform imposes
restrictions on the way that the Jakarta Messaging API may be used by applications,
and those restrictions are described here.

The Jakarta Messaging specification does not define how a Jakarta EE container integrates
with its Jakarta Messaging provider. Different Jakarta EE containers may integrate with
their Jakarta Messaging provider in different ways.

=== Restrictions on the use of Jakarta Messaging API in the Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container

Jakarta Messaging applications which run in the Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container are
subject to a number of restrictions in the way the Jakarta Messaging API may be used.
These restrictions are necessary for the following reasons:

* In a Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container, a Jakarta Messaging provider operates as a
transactional resource manager which must participate in Jakarta
transactions as defined in the Jakarta EE platform specification. This
overrides the behaviour of Jakarta Messaging sessions as defined elsewhere in the Jakarta Messaging
specification. For more details see section 12.3 “Behaviour of Jakarta Messaging sessions in the Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container”.
* The Jakarta EE web containers or Enterprise Beans containers need to be able to manage the
threads used to run applications.
* The Jakarta EE web containers and Enterprise Beans containers perform connection management which
may include the pooling of Jakarta Messaging connections.
+
The restrictions described in this section do not apply to the Jakarta EE
application client container.

Applications running in the Jakarta EE web containers and Enterprise Beans containers must not
attempt to create more than one active (not closed) Session object per
connection.

* If an application attempts to use the Connection object’s
createSession method when an active Session object exists for that
connection then a JMSException should be thrown.
* If an application attempts to use the JMSContext object’s
createContext method then a JMSRuntimeException must be thrown, since
the first JMSContext already contains a connection and session and this
method would create a second session on the same connection.

The following methods are intended for use by the application server and
their use by applications running in the Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container
may interfere with the container’s ability to properly manage the
threads used in the runtime environment. They must therefore not be
called by applications running in the Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container:

* jakarta.jms.Session method setMessageListener
* jakarta.jms.Session method getMessageListener
* jakarta.jms.Session method run
* jakarta.jms.Connection method createConnectionConsumer
* jakarta.jms.Connection method createSharedConnectionConsumer
* jakarta.jms.Connection method createDurableConnectionConsumer
* jakarta.jms.Connection method createSharedDurableConnectionConsumer
+
The following methods may interfere with the container’s ability to
properly manage the threads used in the runtime environment and must not
be used by applications running in the Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container:
* jakarta.jms.MessageConsumer method setMessageListener
* jakarta.jms.MessageConsumer method getMessageListener
* jakarta.jms.JMSContext method setMessageListener
* jakarta.jms.JMSContext method getMessageListener
+
This restriction means that applications running in the Jakarta EE web container or
Enterprise Beans container which need to receive messages asynchronously may only do
so using message-driven beans.

The following methods may interfere with the container’s management of
connections and must not be used by applications running in the Jakarta EE
web container or Enterprise Beans container:

* jakarta.jms.Connection method setClientID
* jakarta.jms.Connection method stop
* jakarta.jms.Connection method setExceptionListener
* jakarta.jms.JMSContext method setClientID
* jakarta.jms.JMSContext method stop
* jakarta.jms.JMSContext method setExceptionListener

Applications which need to use a specific client identifier must set it
on the connection factory, as described in section 6.1.2 “Client
identifier”.

An asynchronous send is not permitted in a Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container.
The following methods must therefore not be used in a Jakarta EE web web container or Enterprise Beans container:

* jakarta.jms.MessageProducer method send(Message message,
CompletionListener completionListener)
* jakarta.jms.MessageProducer method send(Message message, int
deliveryMode, int priority, long timeToLive, CompletionListener
completionListener)
* jakarta.jms.MessageProducer method send(Destination destination, Message
message, CompletionListener completionListener)
* jakarta.jms.MessageProducer method send(Destination destination, Message
message, int deliveryMode, int priority, long timeToLive,
CompletionListener completionListener)
* jakarta.jms.JMSProducer method setAsync(CompletionListener
completionListener)
+
All the methods listed in this section may throw a
jakarta.jms.JMSException (if allowed by the method) or a
jakarta.jms.JMSRuntimeException (if not) when called by an application
running in the Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container. This is recommended but not
required.

=== Behaviour of Jakarta Messaging sessions in the Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container

The behaviour of Jakarta Messaging Session and JMSContext objects in respect of +
transactions and message acknowledgement is different for applications +
which run in a Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container than it is for
applications +
which run in a normal Java SE environment or in the Jakarta EE
application +
client container.

When an application creates a Session or JMSContext in a Jakarta EE web container +
or Enterprise Beans container, and there is an active Jakarta transaction in progress, +
then the session that is created will participate in the Jakarta +
transaction and will be committed or rolled back when the Jakarta +
transaction is committed or rolled back. Any session parameters that +
are specified when creating the Session or JMSContext are ignored. The +
use of local transactions or client acknowledgement is not permitted.

This applies irrespective of whether the Jakarta transaction is demarcated +
automatically by the container or programmatically using methods on +
jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction.

The term “session parameters” here refers to the arguments that may be +
passed into a call to the createSession or createContext methods to +
specify whether the session should use a local transaction and, if the +
session is non-transacted, what the acknowledgement mode should be.

When an application uses one of the createSession methods to create +
a Session, and there is no active Jakarta transaction in progress, +
then:

* If the session parameters specify that the session should be
non-transacted with an acknowledgement mode of AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or
DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE then the session will be non-transacted and messages
will be acknowledged according to the specified acknowledgement mode.
* If the session parameters specify that the session should be
non-transacted with an acknowledgement mode of CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE then
the Jakarta Messaging provider is recommended to ignore the specified parameters and
instead provide a non-transacted, auto-acknowledged session. However the
Jakarta Messaging provider may alternatively provide a non-transacted session with
client acknowledgement.
* If the session parameters specify that the session should be
transacted, +
then the Jakarta Messaging provider is recommended to ignore the specified parameters
and instead provide a non-transacted, auto-acknowledged session. However
the Jakarta Messaging provider may alternatively provide a local transacted session.
* Applications running in a Jakarta EE web web container or Enterprise Beans container are recommended
to specify no session parameters or to specify that the session be
non-transacted with an acknowledgement mode of AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or
DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE.
* It is not recommended that applications specify client acknowledgement
or a local transaction since applications may not be portable.
Furthermore if the Jakarta Messaging provider does support the use of client
acknowledgement and local transactions when there is no Jakarta transaction,
the application would need to be written differently dependent on
whether there was a Jakarta transaction or not.

When an application uses one of the createContext methods to create +
a JMSContext, and there is no active Jakarta transaction in progress, +
then:

* If the specified session mode is AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or
DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE then the session will be non-transacted and messages
will be acknowledged according to the specified acknowledgement mode.
* If the specified session mode is CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE or
SESSION_TRANSACTED then it will be ignored and a session mode of
AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE used.
* Applications running in a Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container are recommended
to specify no session parameters or to specify that the session be
non-transacted with an acknowledgement mode of AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or
DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE.
* The use of local transactions or client acknowledgement is not
permitted in a Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container even if there is no active +
Jakarta transaction because this would require applications to be written +
differently depending on whether there was a Jakarta transaction or not.

When programmatic transaction demarcation is being used, the session
should be both created and used within an active Jakarta transaction.

If a Session or JMSContext is created when there is an active Jakarta
transaction, then after that transaction is committed or rolled back the
session remains available for use in any subsequent Jakarta transaction
until the Session or JMSContext is closed.

However, if a Session or JMSContext is created when there is an active
Jakarta transaction but is subsequently used to send or receive messages
when there is no active Jakarta transaction then the behaviour is undefined.

Similarly, if a Session or JMSContext is created when there is no active
Jakarta transaction but subsequently used to send or receive messages when
there is an active Jakarta transaction then the behaviour is undefined.

The Bean Provider should not make use of the Jakarta Messaging request/reply paradigm
(sending of a Jakarta Messaging message, followed by the synchronous receipt of a
reply to that message) within a single transaction. Because a Jakarta Messaging
message is typically not delivered to its final destination until the
transaction commits, the receipt of the reply within the same
transaction will not take place.

=== Injection of JMSContext objects

==== Support for injection

Injection of JMSContext objects is supported in those Jakarta EE
application classes which support dependency injection using CDI and for
which CDI support has been enabled by means of a META_INF/beans.xml
descriptor.

Section EE.5.24 of the Jakarta EE specification lists the application
classes that support dependency injection using CDI.

Section 12.1 of the CDI specification specifies how CDI support may be
enabled for a particular application.

==== Container-managed and application-managed JMSContexts

A JMSContext object which has been injected is described as being
_container-managed_, as it is created and closed by the container, not
the application.

A JMSContext object which has been created by calling the
ConnectionFactory method createContext is described as being
_application-managed_. The application is responsible for calling the
close method when the object is not longer needed.

==== Injection syntax

Applications may declare a field of type jakarta.jms.JMSContext and
annotate it with the jakarta.inject.Inject annotation:

----
@Inject
private JMSContext context;
----

The container will inject a JMSContext. This object will have a scope as
defined by section 12.4.4 “Scope of injected JMSContext objects”.

The annotation jakarta.jms.JMSConnectionFactory may be used to specify the
JNDI lookup name of the ConnectionFactory used to create the JMSContext.
For example:

----
@Inject
@JMSConnectionFactory("jms/connectionFactory")
private JMSContext context;
----

If the JMSConnectionFactory annotation is omitted then the platform
default Jakarta Messaging connection factory will be used.

The annotation jakarta.jms.JMSPasswordCredential may be used to specify a
user name and password which will be used when the JMSContext is
created. For example:

----
@Inject
@JMSConnectionFactory("jms/connectionFactory")
@JMSPasswordCredential(
    userName="admin",password="mypassword")
private JMSContext context;
----

The annotation jakarta.jms.JMSSessionMode may be used to specify the
session mode of the JMSContext. For example:

----
@Inject
@JMSConnectionFactory("jms/connectionFactory")
@JMSSessionMode(JMSContext.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE)
private JMSContext context;
----

The meaning and possible values of session mode are the same as for the
ConnectionFactory method createContext(int sessionMode):

* In the Jakarta EE application client container, session mode may be set
to any of JMSContext.SESSION_TRANSACTED, JMSContext.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE,
JMSContext.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or JMSContext.DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE. If no
session mode is specified or the JMSSessionMode annotation is omitted a
session mode of JMSContext.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE will be used.
* In a Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container, when there is an active Jakarta
transaction in progress, session mode is ignored and the JMSSessionMode
annotation is unnecessary.
* In a Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container, when there is no active Jakarta
transaction in progress, session mode may be set to either of
JMSContext.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or JMSContext.DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE. If no
session mode is specified or the JMSSessionMode annotation is omitted a
session mode of JMSContext.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE will be used.

For more information about the use of session mode when creating a
messaging context, see section 12.3 “Behaviour of Jakarta Messaging sessions in the
Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container” and the API documentation for the
ConnectionFactory method createContext(int sessionMode).

==== Scope of injected JMSContext objects

The scope of an injected JMSContext defines whether different injected
JMSContext objects will actually refer to the same JMSContext object.

It also defines when the injected JMSContext will be closed by the
container. When the object falls out of scope, the container will
automatically call close().

The scope of an injected JMSContext object will depend on whether there
is a Jakarta transaction in progress at the point where a particular method
on the JMSContext is called.

* If a method is called on an injected JMSContext when there is a Jakarta
transaction (either bean-managed or container-managed), the scope of the
JMSContext will be @TransactionScoped. This scope is defined in the Jakarta Transactions
specification. This means that:
** The JMSContext object will be automatically created the first time a
method on the JMSContext is called within the transaction.
** The JMSContext object will be automatically closed when the
transaction is committed or rolled back.
** Within the same Jakarta transaction, JMSContext objects injected using
identical annotations will refer to the same JMSContext object.
* If a method is called on an injected JMSContext when there is no Jakarta
transaction then the scope of the JMSContext will be @RequestScoped.
This scope is defined in the CDI specification. This means that:
** The JMSContext object will be automatically created the first time a
method on the JMSContext is called within a request.
** The JMSContext object will be automatically closed when the request
ends.
** Within the same request, JMSContext objects injected using identical
annotations will refer to the same JMSContext object.
* If a method is called on an injected JMSContext both in a Jakarta
transaction and outside a Jakarta transaction then separate JMSContext
objects will be used in each case, with a separate JMSContext object
being used for each Jakarta transaction as described above.

==== Restrictions on use of injected JMSContext objects

Within the same scope, different injected JMSContext objects which are
injected using identical annotations will all refer to the same
JMSContext object.

This means that they will all use the same connection. This will reduce
the resource usage of the application and improve performance.

It also means that messages would be sent using the same session.
Messages sent using different JMSContext objects in the same scope will
be therefore received in order in which they were sent (see section
6.2.9.2 “Order of message sends” for a few qualifications).

However, to avoid the possibility of code in one bean having an
unexpected effect on a different bean, the following methods which
change the public state of a JMSContext will not be permitted if the
JMSContext is injected.

* setClientID
* setExceptionListener
* stop
* acknowledge
* commit
* rollback
* recover
* setAutoStart
* start
* close

These methods must throw a IllegalStateRuntimeException if the
JMSContext is injected. These restrictions do not apply when the
JMSContext is managed by the application; though note that several of
these methods are in any case prohibited in a Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container.

== Resource adapter

The Jakarta Connectors specification defines a
standard architecture for connecting the Jakarta EE platform to enterprise
information systems (EISs).

A Jakarta Messaging provider (whether it forms part of a Jakarta EE application server or
not) is recommended to include a resource adapter which connects to that
Jakarta Messaging provider and which conforms to the Jakarta Connectors
specification and as further specified in this chapter.

=== MDB activation properties

Message-driven beans are defined in the Jakarta Enterprise Beans
specification. Jakarta Messaging defines the following activation properties for
message-driven beans.

Table 13‑1 MDB activation properties defined by Jakarta Messaging

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|*Activation property* |*Description*
|destinationLookup |This property may be used to specify the lookup name
of an administratively-defined jakarta.jms.Queue or jakarta.jms.Topic object
which defines the Jakarta Messaging queue or topic from which the endpoint
(message-driven bean) is to receive messages.

|connectionFactoryLookup |This property may be used to specify the
lookup name of an administratively-defined jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory,
jakarta.jms.QueueConnectionFactory or jakarta.jms.TopicConnectionFactory
object that will be used to connect to the Jakarta Messaging provider from which the
endpoint (message-driven bean) is to receive messages.

|acknowledgeMode a|
If bean-managed transaction demarcation is used, this property may be
used to indicate whether Jakarta Messaging AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE semantics or
DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE semantics should apply.

This property may be set to either Auto-acknowledge or
Dups-ok-acknowledge. If this property is not specified, a default of
Auto-acknowledge will be used.

|messageSelector |This property may be used to specify a message
selector. If this property is not specified then a message selector will
not be used.

|destinationType |This property may be used to specify whether the
specified destination is a queue or topic. The valid values are
jakarta.jms.Queue or jakarta.jms.Topic.

|subscriptionDurability a|
This property only applies to endpoints (message-driven beans) that
receive messages published to a topic. It may be used to specify whether
the subscription is durable or non-durable.

This property may be set to either Durable or NonDurable. If this
property is not specified, a default of NonDurable will be used.

|clientId a|
This property may be used to specify the client identifier that will be
used when connecting to the Jakarta Messaging provider from which the endpoint
(message-driven bean) is to receive messages.

Setting this property is always optional.

|subscriptionName a|
This property only applies to endpoints (message-driven beans) that
receive messages published to a topic. It may be used to specify the
name of the durable or non-durable subscription.

It is not defined whether a shared or unshared subscription is used.

|===

== Examples of the classic API

This chapter gives some code examples that show how a Jakarta Messaging client could
use the Jakarta Messaging classic API. It also demonstrates how to use several message
types.

It is recommended that either the classic API or the simplified API be
used in preference to the domain-specific APIs for point-to-point
messaging. See also chapter 15 “Examples of the simplified API”.

In the example program, a client application sends and receives stock
quote information. The messages the client application receives are from
a stock quote service that sends out stock quote messages. The stock
quote service is not described in the example.

To simplify the example, no exception-handling code is included.

This chapter describes the steps for creating the correct environment
for sending and receiving a message.

After describing these basic functions, this chapter describes how to
perform some other common functions, such as using message selectors.

=== Preparing to send and receive messages

Here are the basic steps to establish a connection and prepare to send
and receive messages.

* Get a ConnectionFactory and Destination
* Create a Connection and Session
* Create a MessageConsumer
* Create a MessageProducer

==== Getting a ConnectionFactory

Both the message producer and message consumer (the sender and receiver)
need to get a ConnectionFactory and use it to set up both a Connection
and a Session.

An administrator typically has created and configured a
ConnectionFactory for the Jakarta Messaging client’s use. The client program typically
uses the JNDI API to look up the ConnectionFactory.

----
import javax.naming.*;
import jakarta.jms.*;

Context namingContext = new InitialContext();
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory =
    (ConnectionFactory) namingContext.lookup("myCF");
----

==== Getting a Destination

An administrator has created and configured a Queue named "StockSource"
which is where stock quote messages are sent and received. Again, the
destination can be looked up using the JNDI API.

----
Queue stockQueue = (Queue)namingContext.lookup("StockSource");
----

==== Creating a Connection

Having obtained the ConnectionFactory, the client program uses it to
create a Connection.

----
Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();
----

A Connection must be closed after use. This may be done explicitly using
the close method:

----
connection.close();
----

Alternatively a connection may be closed automatically using the
try-with-resources statement:

----
try (Connection connection=connectionFactory.createConnection()) {
    // use connection in this try block
    // it will be closed when try block completes
} catch (JMSException e) {
    // exception handling
}
----

==== Creating a Session

Having obtained the Connection, the client program uses it to create a
Session. The Session is used to create a MessageProducer (to send
messages) or a MessageConsumer (to receive messages).

There are three createSession methods on Connection, with different
numbers of arguments. Java SE applicatrions such as this example should
use the method with one integer argument, sessionMode. This single
argument indicates

* whether the session will use a local transaction or whether it is
non-transacted and,
* if the session is non-transacted, what mode should be used for
acknowledging the receipt of messages.

----
// Session is not transacted and
// uses AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE for message acknowledgement

Session session=connection.createSession(Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
----

==== Creating a MessageProducer

Having obtained the Session, the client program uses the Session to
create a MessageProducer. The MessageProducer object is used to send
messages to the destination. The MessageProducer is created by using the
Session.createProducer method, supplying as a parameter the destination
to which the messages are sent.

----
// stockQueue was previously looked up using JNDI

MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(stockQueue);
----

==== Creating a MessageConsumer

Messages can be consumed either synchronously or asynchronously. This
example shows how to create a message consumer that consumes messages
synchronously. See section 14.3.1 “Receiving messages asynchronously” to
learn more about consuming messages asynchronously.

A MessageConsumer is used to receive messages from the destination,
which in this example is the Queue stockQueue. A MessageConsumer is
created using the Session.createConsumer method, supplying one
parameter, the destination from which messages are received.

----
// stockQueue was previously looked up using JNDI

MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(stockQueue);
----

==== Starting message delivery

Up until this point, delivery of messages has been inhibited so that the
preceding setup could be done without being interrupted with
asynchronously delivered messages. Now that the setup is complete, the
Connection is told to begin the delivery of messages to its
MessageConsumer.

----
connection.start();
----

==== Using a TextMessage

There are several Jakarta Messaging Message formats. For this example, the stock quote
information is sent as a text string that is read and displayed by the
client.

The following demonstrates how to create such a message:

----
String stockData; // Stock information as a string

// Set the message's text to be the stockData string
TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage();
message.setText(stockData);
----

=== Sending and receiving messages

Now that the setup of the Session is complete, you can send and receive
messages. This section describes how to:

* Create a message
* Send a message
* Receive a message synchronously

==== Sending a message

To send a message, use the MessageProducer.send method, supplying a
Message object for the method’s parameter.

----
// Send the message
producer.send(message);
----

==== Receiving a message synchronously

To receive the next message in the queue, you can use the
MessageConsumer.receive method. This call blocks indefinitely until a
message arrives on the queue. The same method can be used to receive
from a topic.

----
Message stockMessage = consumer.receive();
----

To limit the amount of time that the client blocks, use a timeout
parameter with the receive method. If no messages arrive by the end of
the timeout, then the receive method returns. The timeout parameter is
expressed in milliseconds.

----
// Wait up to 4 seconds for a message
Message stockMessage = consumer.receive(4000);
----

==== Unpacking a TextMessage

The stock quote information is sent using a TextMessage__.__ There are
two ways to extract the information from the message.

The receive method returns a Message object. You can cast this to a
TextMessage and call the getText method. This returns the message
content as a string:

----
// extract stock information from message
String newStockData = ((TextMessage)stockMessage).getText();
----

Alternatively you can call the Message object’s getBody method. In this
case you do not need to cast the Message to a TextMessage. Instead you
need to pass in the type expected:

----
// extract stock information from message
String newStockData= stockMessage.getBody(String.class);
----

=== Other messaging features

This section goes beyond basic messaging functions, and describes how to
perform some other common messaging functions:

* Create an asynchronous MessageListener
* Use a message selector to filter message delivery
* Create a durable subscription to a topic
* Re-connect to a topic using a durable subscription

==== Receiving messages asynchronously

In order to receive message asynchronously as they are delivered to the
message consumer, the client program needs to create a message listener
that implements the MessageListener interface. An implementation of the
MessageListener interface, called `StockListener.java`, might look
like this:

----
import jakarta.jms.*;

public class StockListener implements MessageListener {
    public void onMessage(Message message) {
    // Unpack and handle the messages received
    ...
    }
}
----

The client program registers the MessageListener object with the
MessageConsumer object in the following way:

----
StockListener myListener = new StockListener();

// consumer is a MessageConsumer object
consumer.setMessageListener(myListener);
----

The Connection must be started for the message delivery to begin. The
MessageListener is asynchronously notified whenever a message has been
published to the queue. This is done via the onMessage method in the
MessageListener interface. It is up to the client to process the message
there.

----
public void onMessage(Message message) {

// Unpack and handle the messages received
    String newStockData =
        ((TextMessage)message).getText();
    if(...) {
        // Logic related to the data
    }
}
----

==== Using message selection

A client program may be interested in receiving only certain stock
quotes. A message selector can be used to achieve this goal. Message
selectors work against properties that are assigned to the message.

In this example, the client program is only interested in technology
related stocks. The sender of the messages assigns a value to a message
property called `StockSector`. The values the sender assigns include
"`Technology`", "`Financial`", "`Manufacturing`", "`Emerging`", and "`Global`".
The message sender assigns these property values by using the
`Message.setStringProperty` method.

----
String stockData; // Stock information as a String

// Set the message's text to be the stockData string
TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage();
message.setText(stockData);

// Set the message property "StockSector"
message.setStringProperty("StockSector", "Technology");
----

When the client program that receives the stock quote messages creates a
MessageConsumer, it can supply a message selector string which specifies
which messages it will receive.

----
String selector = new String("(StockSector = 'Technology')");
MessageConsumer consumer =
    session.createConsumer(stockQueue,selector);
----

The client program receives only messages related to the technology
sector.

==== Using durable subscriptions

Durable subscriptions are used to receive messages from a topic. When a
Jakarta Messaging client creates a durable subscription, the client can later
disconnect from the topic. When the client program re-connects, it can
receive the messages that arrived while it was disconnected. In this
example, the topic provides information about news updates.

===== Creating a durable subscription

The following example sets up a durable subscription that gets messages
from a topic.

First, the client program must perform the usual setup steps of looking
up ConnectionFactory and a Destination, and creating a Connection and
Session, as described in section 14.1 “Preparing to send and receive
messages”.

----
import javax.naming.*;
import jakarta.jms.*;

// Look up connection factory
Context namingContext = new InitialContext();
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory =
    (ConnectionFactory) namingContext.lookup("ConnectionFactory")

// Look up destination
Topic newsFeedTopic = namingContext.lookup("BreakingNews");

// Create connection and session
Connection connection = ConnectionFactory.createConnection();
Session session=connection.createSession(Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
----

Having performed the normal setup, the client program can now create a
durable subscription on the destination. To do this, the client program
uses the Session method `createDurableConsumer`.

----
MessageConsumer consumer =
    session.createDurableConsumer(newsFeedTopic,"mySubscription");
----

The name "`mySubscription`" is used as an identifier of the durable
subscription.

At this point, the client program can start the connection and receive
messages.

===== Creating a consumer on an existing durable subscription

Once a durable subscription has been created it will continue to
accumulate messages until the subscription is deleted using the Session
method unsubscribe, even if the original MessageConsumer is closed.

A client application may create a consumer on an existing durable
subscription by calling the Session method createDurableConsumer,
supplying the same parameters that were specified when the durable
subscription was first created.

----
// Create a consumer on an existing durable subscription
MessageConsumer consumer =
    session.createDurableConsumer(newsFeedTopic, "mySubscription");
----

Any messages which were added to the subscription whilst it had no
consumer will be delivered.

A durable subscription created using `createDurableConsumer` may only have
one consumer at a time.

A durable subscription created using `createSharedDurableConsumer` may
have may have more than one consumer at a time. Each message from the
subscription will be delivered to only one of the consumers on that
subscription.

When creating a consumer on an existing durable subscription there are
some important restrictions to be aware of:

* The Destination and subscription name must be the same as when the
durable subscription was first created.
* If the connection’s client identifier was set when the durable
subscription was first created then the same client identifier must be
set when subsequently creating a consumer on it.
* If a message selector was specified when the durable subscription was
first created then the same message selector must be specified when
subsequently creating a consumer on it.

=== Jakarta Messaging message types

There are five Jakarta Messaging message types. This section provides an example of
how to create and unpack each of these types. In each example, the data
sent in the message is stock-quote-related data. In all cases, the code
that creates the actual content of the messages is omitted.

==== Creating a TextMessage

In this example, the stock quote information is sent as a
TextMessage. A TextMessage carries the message as a text string that
can be read by the client.

The following code demonstrates how to create such a message:

----
String stockData; // Stock information as a string

TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage();

// Set the stockData string to the message body
message.setText(stockData);
----

==== Unpacking a TextMessage

There are two ways to extract the text from a TextMessage. You can
call the `getText` method on TextMessage:

----
String stockData = stockMessage.getText();
----

Alternatively you can call the `getBody` method on Message, which is the
common supertype of all message types. In this case you need to pass in
the body type expected:

----
String stockData = stockMessage.getBody(String.class);
----

The use of `getBody` avoids the need to cast a newly-received Message
object to a TextMessage.

==== Creating a BytesMessage

The stock quote information could be in a binary format that the server
knows how to construct and that the client program knows how to
interpret and display as a stock quote. This is sent as a BytesMessage.

Such a message can be constructed in the following way:

----
// Stock information as a byte array
byte[] stockData;
BytesMessage message = session.createBytesMessage();
message.writeBytes(stockData);
----

==== Unpacking a BytesMessage

There are several ways to extract the byte array from a BytesMessage.
The simplest is to call the `readBytes` method on BytesMessage. This
copies the bytes to the specified byte array.

----
int bodyLength = message.getBodyLength();
byte[] stockData = new byte[bodyLength];
int bytesCopied = message.readBytes(stockData);
----

The `readBytes` method can also be used to read bytes in increments, by
supplying a byte array whose length is less than the number of bytes
available. The `readBytes` method will fill the array and set the return
value to the number of bytes copied. A subsequent call reads the next
increment and so on.

Alternatively you can call the getBody method on Message, which is the
common supertype of all message types. In this case you need to pass in
the body type expected. This method creates a byte array of the required
size and copies all the bytes to it:

----
byte[] stockData = message.getBody(byte[].class);
----

The use of getBody avoids the need to cast a newly-received Message
object to a BytesMessage.

==== Creating a MapMessage

Each stock message sent by the server could be a map of various stock
quote name/value pairs, using a MapMessage. For example, it could
contain entries for:

* Stock quote name - represented as a String
* Current value - represented as a double
* Time of quote - represented as a long
* Last change - represented as a double
* Stock information - represented as a String

To construct the MapMessage, the client program uses the various set
methods (setString, setLong, and so forth) that are associated with
MapMessage, and sets each named value in the MapMessage.

----
String stockName; // Name of the stock
double stockValue; // Current value of the stock
long stockTime; // Time stock quote was updated */
double stockDiff; // +/- change in the stock quote*/
String stockInfo; // Information on this stock */
MapMessage message = session.createMapMessage();
----

Note that the following can be set in any order.

----
// First parameter is the name of the map element,
// Second parameter is the value
message.setString("Name", "ORCL");
message.setDouble("Value", stockValue);
message.setLong("Time", stockTime);
message.setDouble("Diff", stockDiff);
message.setString(
    "Info", "Recent server announcement causes market interest");
----

==== Unpacking a MapMessage

There are two ways to extract body data from a MapMessage.

You can use the various get methods associated with MapMessage to get
the values in the named MapMessage elements. In the following example,
the client program expects certain MapMessage elements.

----
String stockName; // Name of the stock
double stockValue; // Current value of the stock
long stockTime; // Time stock quote was updated
double stockDiff; // +/- change in the stock
String stockInfo; // Information on this stock
----

The data is retrieved from the message by using a get method and
providing the name of the value desired. The elements from the
MapMessage can be obtained in any order.

----
stockName = message.getString("Name");
stockDiff = message.getDouble("Diff");
stockValue = message.getDouble("Value");
stockTime = message.getLong("Time");
----

Alternatively you can call the getBody method on Message, which is the
common supertype of all message types. In this case you need to pass in
the body type expected. This method returns a `java.util.Map` containing
all the keys and values in the MapMessage.

----
Map stockData = message.getBody(Map.class);
stockName = (String)stockData.getString("Name");
stockDiff = (Double)stockData.getDouble("Diff");
stockValue = (Double)stockData.getDouble("Value");
stockTime = (Long)stockData.getLong("Time");
----

The use of getBody avoids the need to cast a newly-received Message
object to a BytesMessage.

If an application needs to get a list of the elements in a MapMessage,
it can use the method MapMessage.getMapNames.

==== Creating a StreamMessage

In a similar fashion to the MapMessage, an application could send a
message consisting of various fields written in sequence to the message,
each in their own primitive type. To do this, it would use a
StreamMessage. Here’s the primitive types assigned to each item in the
stock quote message.

* Stock quote name - String
* Current value - double
* Time of quote - long
* Last change - double
* Stock information - String

The client program might be interested in only some of the message
fields, but in the case of a StreamMessage, the client has to read and
potentially discard each field in turn.

In the following example, the values for each of the following have
already been set:

----
String stockName; // Name of the stock
double stockValue; // Current value of the stock
long stockTime; // Time stock quote was updated
double stockDiff; // +/- change in the stock quote
String stockInfo; // Information on this stock

// Create message
StreamMessage message = session.createStreamMessage();
----

The following elements have to be written to the StreamMessage in the
order they will be read. Notice that they are not separately named
properties, as in MapMessage.

----
// Set data for message
message.writeString(stockName);
message.writeDouble(stockValue);
message.writeLong(stockTime);
message.writeDouble(stockDiff);
message.writeString(stockInfo);
----

==== Unpacking a StreamMessage

The elements of a StreamMessage have to be read in the order they were
written.

----
String stockName; // Name of the stock quote
double stockValue; // Current value of the stock
long stockTime; // Time stock quote was updated
double stockDiff; // +/- change in the stock quote
String stockInfo; // Information on this stock

stockName = message.readString();
stockValue = message.readDouble();
stockTime = message.readLong();
stockDiff = message.readDouble();
stockInfo = message.readString();
----

The getBody method cannot be used with a StreamMessage.

==== Creating an ObjectMessage

The stock information could be sent in the form of a special `StockObject`
Java object. This object can then be sent as the body of a
ObjectMessage. The ObjectMessage can be used to send Java objects.

These values are set using methods that are unique to the `StockObject`
implementation. For example, `StockObject` may have methods that set the
various data values. An application using `StockObject` might look like
this:

----
String stockName; // Name of the stock quote
double stockValue; // Current value of the stock
long stockTime; // Time stock quote was updated
double stockDiff; // +/- change in the stock quote
String stockInfo; // Information on this stock

// Create a StockObject
StockObject stockObject = new StockObject();

// Establish the values for the StockObject
stockObject.setName(stockName);
stockObject.setValue(stockValue);
stockObject.setTime(stockTime);
stockObject.setDiff(stockDiff);
stockObject.setInfo(stockInfo);
----

To create an ObjectMessage with the `StockObject` as the message body, you
would do the following:

----
// Create an ObjectMessage
ObjectMessage message = session.createObjectMessage();

// Set the body of the message to the StockObject
message.setObject(stockObject);
----

==== Unpacking an ObjectMessage

There are two ways to extract the object from an ObjectMessage. You can
call the getObject method on ObjectMessage:

----
// Retrieve the StockObject from the message
StockObject stockObject = (StockObject)message.getObject();

// Extract data from the StockObject using StockObject methods
String stockName; // Name of the stock quote
double stockValue; // Current value of the stock
long stockTime; // Time stock quote was updated
double stockDiff; // +/- change in the stock quote
String stockInfo; // Information on this stock

stockName = stockObject.getName();
stockValue = stockObject.getValue();
stockTime = stockObject.getTime();
stockDiff = stockObject.getDiff();
stockInfo = stockObject.getInfo();
----

Alternatively you can call the getBody method on Message, which is the
common supertype of all message types. In this case you need to specify
the object type expected:

----
StockObject stockObject = message.getBody(StockObject.class);

// Extract data from the StockObject using StockObject methods
String stockName; // Name of the stock quote
double stockValue; // Current value of the stock
long stockTime; // Time stock quote was updated
double stockDiff; // +/- change in the stock quote
String stockInfo; // Information on this stock

stockName = stockObject.getName();
stockValue = stockObject.getValue();
stockTime = stockObject.getTime();
stockDiff = stockObject.getDiff();
stockInfo = stockObject.getInfo();
----

The use of getBody avoids the need to cast a newly-received Message
object to an ObjectMessage. It also avoids the need to cast the object
returned by getObject to the appropriate type.

== Examples of the simplified API

The examples in this section compare the use of the classic and
simplified Jakarta Messaging APIs for some common Jakarta Messaging operations.

=== Sending a message (Jakarta EE)

This example compares the use of the classic and simplified Jakarta Messaging APIs for
sending a TextMessage in a Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container.

==== Example using the classic API

Here’s how you might do this using the classic API:

----
@Resource(lookup = "jms/connectionFactory")
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;

@Resource(lookup="jms/dataQueue")
Queue dataQueue;

public void sendMessageOld (String body) throws JMSException {
    try (Connection connection =
        connectionFactory.createConnection()){
        Session session = connection.createSession();
        MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(dataQueue);
        TextMessage textMessage = session.createTextMessage(body);
        messageProducer.send(textMessage);
    }
}

==== Example using the simplified API

Here’s how you might do this using the simplified API:

----
@Resource(lookup = "jms/connectionFactory")
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;

@Resource(lookup="jms/dataQueue")
Queue dataQueue;

public void sendMessageNew (String body) {
    try (JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext();){
        context.createProducer().send(dataQueue,body);
    }
}
----

Note that sendMessageNew does not need to throw JMSException.

==== Example using the simplified API and injection

Here's how you might do this using the simplified API with the
JMSContext created by injection:

----
@Inject
@JMSConnectionFactory("jms/connectionFactory")
private JMSContext context;

@Resource(mappedName = "jms/dataQueue")
private Queue dataQueue;

public void sendMessageNew(String body) {
    context.createProducer().send(dataQueue, body);

=== Sending a message (Java SE)

This example compares the use of the classic and simplified Jakarta Messaging APIs for sending a TextMessage in a Java SE environment.

==== Example using the classic API

Here’s how you might do this using the classic API:

    throws JMSException, NamingException{

    InitialContext namingContext = getInitialContext();
    ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = (ConnectionFactory)
    namingContext.lookup("jms/connectionFactory");
    Queue dataQueue = (Queue) namingContext.lookup("jms/dataQueue")
    try (Connection connection =
            connectionFactory.createConnection()) {
        Session session = connection.createSession();
        MessageProducer messageProducer =
        session.createProducer(dataQueue);
        TextMessage textMessage = session.createTextMessage(body);

=== Sending a message with properties (Java SE)

This example is similar to the previous example in that it compares the
use of the classic and simplified Jakarta Messaging APIs for sending a TextMessage in
a Java SE environment.

However this example also configures various attributes of the message
that is sent:

* The message property "`foo`" is set to a value of "`bar`".
* The message is sent using a delivery mode of `NON_PERSISTENT`.
* The Jakarta Messaging provider is informed that message timestamps are not required.

==== Example using the classic API

Here’s how you might do this using the classic API:

----
public void sendMessageOld(String body)

            connectionFactory.createConnection()) {
        Session session = connection.createSession();
        MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(dataQueue);
        TextMessage textMessage = session.createTextMessage(body);
        textMessage.setStringProperty("foo", "bar");
        messageProducer.setDeliveryMode(NON_PERSISTENT);
        messageProducer.setDisableMessageTimestamp(true);

            setTimeToLive(10000).
            setDeliveryMode(NON_PERSISTENT).
            setDisableMessageTimestamp(true).
            send(dataQueue, body);

=== Receiving synchronously and sending a message in the same local transaction (Java SE)

This example compares the use of the classic and simplified Jakarta Messaging APIs for
the use case in which a Java SE application repeatedly consumes a
message from one queue and forwards it to another queue in a Java SE
environment. In this example each message is received and forwarded in
the same local transaction. This means that the receiving and sending of
the message must be done using the same transacted session which is then
committed.

In this example the application consumes the incoming messages
synchronously. However since this is a Java SE application the message
could also be consumed asynchronously using a MessageListener.

==== Example using the classic API

Here’s how you might do this using the classic API:

----
public void receiveAndSendMessageOld()
        throws JMSException, NamingException {

    InitialContext namingContext = getInitialContext();
    ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = (ConnectionFactory)
        namingContext.lookup("jms/connectionFactory");
    Queue dataQueue = (Queue) namingContext.lookup("jms/dataQueue");
    Queue outboundQueue = (Queue)
        namingContext.lookup("jms/outboundQueue");
    
    try (Connection connection =
            connectionFactory.createConnection()){
        Session session = 
            connection.createSession(SESSION_TRANSACTED);
        MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(dataQueue);
        MessageProducer producer =
            session.createProducer(outboundQueue);
        connection.start();
        
        TextMessage textMessage = null;
        do {
            textMessage = (TextMessage) consumer.receive(1000);
            if (textMessage!=null){
                producer.send(textMessage);
                session.commit();
                }
        } while (textMessage!=null);
    }
}
----

returns a suitable JNDI InitialContext.

==== Example using the simplified API

----
public void receiveAndSendMessageNew() throws NamingException {

    InitialContext namingContext = getInitialContext();
    ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = (ConnectionFactory)
        namingContext.lookup("jms/connectionFactory");
    Queue dataQueue =
        (Queue) namingContext.lookup("jms/dataQueue");
    Queue outboundQueue =
        (Queue) namingContext.lookup("jms/outboundQueue");

    try (JMSContext context =
            connectionFactory.createContext(SESSION_TRANSACTED);){
        JMSConsumer consumer = context.createConsumer(dataQueue);
        TextMessage textMessage = null;
        do {
            textMessage = (TextMessage) consumer.receive(1000);
            if (textMessage != null) {
                context.createProducer().send(
                outboundQueue, textMessage);
                context.commit();
            }
        } while (textMessage != null);
    }
}

In the above example, getInitialContext() is an application method which
returns a suitable JNDI InitialContext.

Note that receiveAndSendMessageNew does not need to throw JMSException.

=== Request/reply pattern using a TemporaryQueue (Jakarta EE)

This example compares the use of the classic and simplified Jakarta Messaging APIs for
implementing a request/reply pattern in a Jakarta EE Enterprise Beans container.

In this example, a session bean (the requestor) sends a request message
to some queue (the request queue). The setJMSReplyTo property of the
request message is set to a TemporaryQueue, to which the reply should be
set. After sending the request, the session bean listens on the
temporary queue until it receives the reply.

Since the request message won’t actually be sent until the transaction
is committed, the request message is sent in a separate transaction from
that used to receive the reply.

A message-driven bean (the responder) listens on the request queue for
request messages. When it receives a message it creates a reply message
and sends it to the reply queue specified in the setJMSReplyTo property
of the incoming message.

When implementing this pattern, the following features of Jakarta Messaging must be
borne in mind:

* The same Connection object that was used to create the TemporaryQueue
must also be used to consume the response message from it. (This is a
restriction of temporary queues).
* If the request message is sent in a transaction then the response
message must be consumed in a separate transaction. That’s why the
message is sent in a separate business which has the transactional
attribute REQUIRES_NEW.

==== Example using the classic API

Here’s how you might implement the requestor this using the classic API:

There are two session beans involved in sending the request message.

The first session bean `RequestReplyOld` creates the creates the temporary
reply queue, calls a second bean `SenderBeanOld` to send the request in a
separate transaction and then listens for the reply:

----
@Stateless
@LocalBean
public class RequestReplyOld {

@Resource(lookup = "jms/connectionFactory")
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;

@EJB private SenderBeanOld senderBean;

@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED)
public String requestReplyOld(String request) throws JMSException {
    
    try (Connection connection =
            connectionFactory.createConnection()) {
        Session session = connection.createSession();
        TemporaryQueue replyQueue = session.createTemporaryQueue();
        
        // call a second bean to
        // send the request message in a separate transaction
        senderBean.sendRequestOld(request,replyQueue);
        
        // now receive the reply, using the same connection
        // as was used to create the temporary reply queue
        MessageConsumer consumer= session.createConsumer(replyQueue);
        connection.start();
        TextMessage reply = (TextMessage) consumer.receive();
        return reply.getText();
    }
}
}
----

The second session bean `SenderBeanOld` simply sends the request to the
request queue in a separate transaction:

----
@Stateless
@LocalBean
public class SenderBeanOld {

@Resource(lookup = "jms/connectionFactory")
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;

@Resource(lookup="jms/requestQueue")
Queue requestQueue;

@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW)
public void sendRequestOld(
        String requestString, TemporaryQueue replyQueue)
        throws JMSException {

    try (Connection connection =
            connectionFactory.createConnection()) {
        Session session = connection.createSession();
        TextMessage requestMessage =
            session.createTextMessage(requestString);
        requestMessage.setJMSReplyTo(replyQueue);
        MessageProducer messageProducer =
            session.createProducer(requestQueue);
        messageProducer.send(requestMessage);
    }
}
}
----

Here is the message-driven bean `RequestResponderOld` which receives
request messages and sends responses:

----
@MessageDriven(mappedName = "jms/requestQueue")
public class RequestResponderOld implements MessageListener {

@Resource(lookup = "jms/connectionFactory")
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;

public void onMessage(Message message) {

    try (Connection connection =
        connectionFactory.createConnection()){
    Session session = connection.createSession();
    // extract request from request message
    String request = ((TextMessage)message).getText();
    // extract temporary reply destination from request message
    Destination replyDestination = message.getJMSReplyTo();
    // prepare response
    TextMessage replyMessage =
        session.createTextMessage("Reply to: "+request);
    // send response
    MessageProducer messageProducer =
        session.createProducer(replyDestination);
    messageProducer.send(replyMessage);
    } catch (JMSException ex) {
        // log an error here
    }
}
}
----

==== Example using the simplified API

Here’s how the same example might look when using the simplified API:

There are two session beans involved in sending the request message. The
first bean

The first session bean `RequestReplyNew` creates the creates the temporary
reply queue, calls a second bean `SenderBeanNew` to send the request in a
separate transaction and then listens for the reply:

----
@Stateless
@LocalBean
public class RequestReplyNew {

@Resource(lookup = "jms/connectionFactory")
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;

@EJB private SenderBeanNew senderBean;

@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED)
public String requestReplyNew(String request) throws JMSException {

    try (JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext()) {
        TemporaryQueue replyQueue = context.createTemporaryQueue();

        // send the request message in a separate transaction
        // so use a separate bean
        // this call may throw JMSException
        senderBean.sendRequestNew(request,replyQueue);

        // now receive the reply, using the same connection
        // as was used to create the temporary reply queue
        JMSConsumer consumer = context.createConsumer(replyQueue);
        return consumer.receiveBody(String.class);
    }
}
}
----

The second session bean `SenderBeanNew` simply sends the request to the
request queue in a separate transaction:

----
@Stateless
@LocalBean
public class SenderBeanNew {

@Resource(lookup = "jms/connectionFactory")
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;

@Resource(lookup="jms/requestQueue")
Queue requestQueue;

@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW)
public void sendRequestNew(
        String requestString, TemporaryQueue replyQueue)
        throws JMSException {

    try (JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext()) {
        TextMessage requestMessage =
            context.createTextMessage(requestString);
        // this call may throw JMSException
        requestMessage.setJMSReplyTo(replyQueue);
        context.createProducer().send(
            requestQueue,requestMessage);
    }
}
}
----

Here is the message-driven bean `RequestResponderNew` which receives
request messages and sends responses:

----
@MessageDriven(mappedName = "jms/requestQueue")
public class RequestResponderNew implements MessageListener {

@Resource(lookup = "jms/connectionFactory")
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;

public void onMessage(Message message) {

    try (JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext()){

        // extract request from request message
        // this may throw a JMSException
        String request = ((TextMessage)message).getText();

        // extract temporary reply destination from request message
        // this may throw a JMSException
        Destination replyDestination = message.getJMSReplyTo();

        // prepare response
        TextMessage replyMessage =
            context.createTextMessage("Reply to: "+request);

        // send response
        context.createProducer().send(replyDestination,replyMessage);
    } catch (JMSException ex) {
        // log an error here
    }
}
}
----

Note that in this example it is not possible to eliminate the need to
declare to catch JMSException since it uses methods on Message and
TextMessage which throw JMSException.

==== Example using the simplified API and injection

Here’s how the same example might look when using the simplified API
with the JMSContext created by injection:

There are two session beans involved in sending the request message. The
first bean

The first session bean `RequestReplyNew` creates the creates the temporary
reply queue, calls a second bean `SenderBeanNew` to send the request in a
separate transaction and then listens for the reply:

----
@Stateless
@LocalBean
public class RequestReplyNew {

@Inject
@JMSConnectionFactory("jms/connectionFactory2")
private JMSContext context;

@EJB private SenderBeanNew senderBean;

@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED)
public String requestReplyNew(String request) throws JMSException {

    TemporaryQueue replyQueue = context.createTemporaryQueue();

    // send the request message in a separate transaction
    // so use a separate bean
    // this call may throw JMSException
    senderBean.sendRequestNew(request,replyQueue);

    // now receive the reply, using the same connection
    // as was used to create the temporary reply queue
    JMSConsumer consumer = context.createConsumer(replyQueue);
    return consumer.receiveBody(String.class);
}
}
----

The second session bean `SenderBeanNew` simply sends the request to the
request queue in a separate transaction:

----
@Stateless
@LocalBean
public class SenderBeanNew {

@Inject
@JMSConnectionFactory("jms/connectionFactory")
private JMSContext context;

@Resource(lookup="jms/requestQueue")
Queue requestQueue;

@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW)
public void sendRequestNew(
        String requestString, TemporaryQueue replyQueue)
        throws JMSException {

    TextMessage requestMessage =
        context.createTextMessage(requestString);
    // this call may throw JMSException
    requestMessage.setJMSReplyTo(replyQueue);
    context.createProducer().send(requestQueue,requestMessage);
}
}
----

Here is the message-driven bean `RequestResponderNew` which receives
request messages and sends responses:

----
@MessageDriven(mappedName = "jms/requestQueue")
public class RequestResponderNew implements MessageListener {

@Inject
@JMSConnectionFactory("jms/connectionFactory")
private JMSContext context;

public void onMessage(Message message) {

    try {
        // extract request from request message
        // this may throw a JMSException
        String request = ((TextMessage)message).getText();

        // extract temporary reply destination from request message
        // this may throw a JMSException
        Destination replyDestination = message.getJMSReplyTo();

        // prepare response
        TextMessage replyMessage =
            context.createTextMessage("Reply to: "+request);

        // send response
        context.createProducer().send(replyDestination,replyMessage);
    } catch (JMSException ex) {
        // log an error here
    }
}
}
----

Note that in this example it is not possible to eliminate the need to
declare to catch JMSException since it uses methods on Message and
TextMessage which throw JMSException.

=== Version 2.0 

All changes made for Jakarta Messaging 2.0 are represented by individual issues in the
Jakarta Messaging specification issue tracker at
http://http://java.net/jira/browse/JMS_SPEC. The appropriate issue
number (e.g. JMS_SPEC-64) is given for each change below.

==== Reorganisation of chapters

This introduction of the simplified API in Jakarta Messaging 2.0 has necessitated a
major reorganisation of this specification.

The structure of the Jakarta Messaging 1.1 specification reflected the domain-specific
APIs introduced in Jakarta Messaging 1.0, with section titles such as
“QueueConnection” and “TopicSubscriber”. This was an inappropriate
structure even in Jakarta Messaging 1.1 since these interfaces had been superseded in
Jakarta Messaging 1.1 by the “unified” API. The addition of the simplified API in Jakarta Messaging
2.0 makes that structure even more inappropriate.

This version of the specification has therefore been completely
restructured along functional lines, with chapter headings such as
“connecting to a Jakarta Messaging provider” and “receiving messages”. These describe
each area of functionality in generic terms followed by a description of
how it is implemented in the various APIs. In general these chapters
contain the same text as in the previous version.

In addition the following completely new chapters have been added:

* chapter 12 “Use of Jakarta Messaging API in Jakarta EE applications”
* chapter 13 “Resource adapter”

==== Jakarta Messaging providers must implement both PTP and Pub-Sub (JMS_SPEC-50)

The specification has been amended to state that a Jakarta Messaging provider must
implement both point-to-point messaging (queues) and publish-subscribe
messaging (topics). This was already required by the Jakarta EE 6
specification, section EE.2.7, but was not previously required by the
Jakarta Messaging specification itself.

The sentence that stated “Providers of Jakarta Messaging point-to-point functionality
are not required to provide publish/subscribe functionality and vice
versa” has been removed.

==== Use of Jakarta Messaging API in Jakarta EE applications (JMS_SPEC-45 and JMS_SPEC-27)

A new chapter 12 “Use of Jakarta Messaging API in Jakarta EE applications” has been
added. This chapter incorporates and clarifies various additional
requirements which were previously only described in the Jakarta EE and Jakarta Enterprise Beans
specifications. Section 12.2 “Restrictions on the use of Jakarta Messaging API in the
Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container” includes a list of methods which may not
be used in a Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container and section 12.3 “Behaviour of
Jakarta Messaging sessions in the Jakarta EE web container or Enterprise Beans container” clarifies how the
arguments to createSession are mostly ignored when used in a Jakarta EE web container
or Enterprise Beans container.

The specification been updated to refer to Jakarta EE 7 rather than J2EE
1.3. A reference has also been added to the new chapter 12 “Use of Jakarta Messaging
API in Jakarta EE applications”.

Section 1.4.8 “Integration of Jakarta Messaging with the Jakarta Enterprise Beans components” has been
deleted. It is superseded by the new chapter 12 “Use of Jakarta Messaging API in Jakarta EE applications”.

==== Resource adapter (JMS_SPEC-25)

A new chapter 13 “Resource adapter” has been added which recommends, but
does not require, that a Jakarta Messaging provider (whether it forms part of a Jakarta EE application server or not) includes a resource adapter which connects
to that Jakarta Messaging provider and which conforms to the Jakarta Connectors specification.

==== MDB activation properties (JMS_SPEC-30, JMS_SPEC-54, JMS_SPEC-55)

A new section 13.1 “MDB activation properties” has been added which
defines a set of activation properties for use with Jakarta Messaging message-driven
beans.

* The acknowledgeMode, messageSelector, destinationType,
subscriptionDurability, clientId and subscriptionName properties were
previously defined in appendix B “Activation Configuration for Message
Inflow to Jakarta Messaging Endpoints” in the Jakarta Connectors
specification, version 1.6. Their definition has now have been moved to
the Jakarta Messaging specification.
* The connectionFactoryLookup property is new and may be used to specify
the the lookup name of an administratively-defined connection factory
which will be used used by the MDB.
* The destinationLookup property is new and may be used to specify the
the lookup name of an administratively-defined queue or topic from which
the MDB will receive messages.
* The activation property clientId is now optional when using a durable
subscription on a topic. This reflects the new shared durable
subscriptions feature in Jakarta Messaging 2.0 which does not require clientId to be
set.

These MDB activation properties are also defined in the Jakarta Enterprise
Beans specification, version 3.2.

==== New methods to create a session (JMS_SPEC-45)

The Connection method createSession(boolean transacted, int
acknowledgeMode) has sometimes been a cause of confusion because if the
transacted argument is set to true then the acknowledgeMode argument is
ignored but must still be given a value.

To simplify application code a new Connection method createSession(int
sessionMode) has been added which provides the same functionality as the
previous method but with a single argument.

Examples 14.1.4 “Creating a Session” and 14.3.3.1 “Creating a durable
subscription” have been updated to use this new method.

In addition, a second new Connection method createSession() has been
added. This has no arguments and is intended for use in a Jakarta EE web container or
Enterprise Beans container in the case when there is an active Jakarta transaction, when
the sessionMode supplied to createSession(int sessionMode) is ignored.

==== New createDurableConsumer methods (JMS_SPEC-51)

The Session interface has been extended to add two createDurableConsumer
methods which return a MessageConsumer.

These are intended to replace the existing createDurableSubscription
methods which return a TopicSubscriber. A TopicSubscriber is a
domain-specific interface whose use has been discouraged since the
domain-independent interfaces were introduced in Jakarta Messaging 1.1.

==== Multiple consumers now allowed on the same topic subscription (JMS_SPEC-40)

In Jakarta Messaging 1.1, a durable or non-durable topic subscription was not
permitted to have more than one consumer at a time. This meant that the
work of processing messages on a subscription could not be shared
amongst multiple threads, connections or JVMs, thereby limiting
scalability. This restriction has therefore been removed in Jakarta Messaging 2.0.

===== Non-durable subscriptions

In order to maintain backwards compatibility with Jakarta Messaging 1.1, the existing
methods for creating non-durable subscriptions remain unchanged.
Subscriptions created using the existing createConsumer methods on
Session and TopicSession and the existing createSubscriber methods on
TopicSession, as well as the new createConsumer methods on JMSContext,
will continue to be restricted to a single consumer and are now referred
to as “unshared non-durable subscriptions”. These are described in a new
section 8.3.1 “Unshared non-durable subscriptions”.

New createSharedConsumer methods have been added to Session,
TopicSession and JMSContext to create a new type of non-durable
subscription which may have more than one consumer. These are referred
to as “shared non-durable subscriptions” and are identified by name and
client identifier (if set). They are described in a new section 8.3.2
“Shared non-durable subscriptions”. The noLocal parameter is not
supported for shared non-durable subscriptions.

===== Durable subscriptions

In order to maintain backwards compatibility with Jakarta Messaging 1.1, the existing
methods for creating durable subscriptions also remain unchanged.
Subscriptions created using the existing createDurableSubscriber methods
on Session and TopicSession, as well as the new createDurableConsumer
methods on Session, TopicSession and JMSContext) will continue to be
restricted to a single consumer and setting the client identifier will
continue to be required. These now referred to as “unshared durable
subscriptions” and are described in a new section 8.3.3 “Unshared
durable subscriptions”.

New createSharedDurableConsumer methods have been added to Session,
TopicSession and JMSContext to create a new type of durable subscription
which may have more than one consumer and which do not require the
client identifier to be set. These are referred to as “shared durable
subscriptions” and are described in a new section 8.3.4 “Shared durable
subscriptions”. The noLocal parameter is not supported for shared
durable subscriptions.

==== Client ID optional on shared durable subscriptions (JMS_SPEC-39)

In Jakarta Messaging 1.1 it was mandatory for the client identifier to be set when
creating or activating a durable subscription.

In Jakarta Messaging 2.0, shared durable subscriptions (see A.1.8 above) will not have
this restriction. However in order to maintain backwards compatibility
with Jakarta Messaging 1.1, unshared durable subscriptions will continue to require
the client identifier to be set.

==== Delivery delay (JMS_SPEC-44)

A new feature “delivery delay” has been added which allows a producing
client to specify the earliest time when a provider may make the message
visible on the target destination and available for delivery to
consumers.

A new section 7.9 “Message delivery delay” and a corresponding new
section 3.4.13 “JMSDeliveryTime” have been added to describe this new
feature. Section 6.2.9.2 “Order of message sends” has been updated to
state that messages with a later delivery time may be delivered after
messages with an earlier delivery time.

Section 6.2.10 “Message acknowledgment” has been updated to state that
when a session’s recover method is called the messages it now delivers
may be different from those that were originally delivered due to the
delivery of messages which could not previously be delivered as they had
not reached their specified delivery time.

Section 7.1 “Producers” has been updated to mention that a client may
now define a default delivery delay for messages sent by a producer.

==== Sending messages asynchronously (JMS_SPEC-43)

New send methods have been added to MessageProducer which allow messages
to be sent asynchronously. These methods permit the Jakarta Messaging provider to
perform part of the work involved in sending the message in a separate
thread. When the send is complete, a callback method is invoked on an
object supplied by the caller. Similar methods are available for
applications using the new JMSProducer interface.

Section 7.1 “Producers” has been extended to describe these additional
send methods.

==== Use of AutoCloseable (JMS_SPEC-53)

The Connection, Session, MessageProducer, MessageConsumer and
QueueBrowser interfaces have been modified to extend the
java.lang.Autocloseable interface. This means that applications can
create these objects using a Java SE 7 try-with-resources statement
which removes the need for applications to explicitly call close() when
these objects are no longer required.

The new JMSContext and JMSConsumer interfaces also extend the
java.lang.Autocloseable interface.

Sections 6.1.8 “Closing a connection” and 6.2.15 “Closing a session”
explain that the use of a try-with-resources statement makes it easier
to ensure that these objects are closed after use.

The example in section 14.1.3 “Creating a Connection” has been extended
to add a second example which uses the the try-with-resources statement.

==== JMSXDeliveryCount (JMS_SPEC-42)

The existing message property JMSXDeliveryCount has been made mandatory.
It was previously optional. This means that Jakarta Messaging providers must set this
property to the number of times the message has been delivered.

A new section 3.5.11 “JMSXDeliveryCount” has been added which describes
this property and explains how it is not required to be guaranteed in
all possible cases, such as after a server failure.

Section 3.5.9 “Jakarta Messaging defined properties” has been updated accordingly.
Some of the wording in this section has been rearranged to reflect the
fact that some properties are optional but that one (JMSXDeliveryCount)
is now mandatory. A clarification has been added to state that the
effect of setting a message selector on a property (such as
JMSXDeliveryCount) which is set by the provider on receive is undefined.

Section 3.4.7 “JMSRedelivered” has been amended to mention the
JMSXDeliveryCount property as well.

Section 6.2.10 “Message acknowledgment”: A sentence which mentions the
JMSRedelivered flag has been amended to mention the JMSXDeliveryCount
property as well.

6.2.11 “Duplicate delivery of messages”: A sentence which mentions the
JMSRedelivered flag has been amended to mention the JMSXDeliveryCount
property as well..

9.1 “Reliability”: A sentence which mentions the JMSRedelivered flag has
been amended to mention the JMSXDeliveryCount property as well.

==== Simplified API (JMS_SPEC-64)

Three new objects JMSContext, JMSProducer and JMSConsumer have been
added which together combine the functionality of the existing
Connection, Session , MessageProducer and MessageConsumer objects. This
provides an alternative API for using Jakarta Messaging which is referred to in this
specification as the “simplified API”.

JMSContext objects may be created using new methods on
ConnectionFactory. Jakarta EE applications may alternatively create
JMSContext objects using injection.

The simplified API is described in section 2.8 “Simplified API
interfaces”.

Developers now have a choice as to whether to use the “classic” API (the
Connection, Session, MessageProducer and MessageConsumer objects) or the
“simplified API” (the JMSContext, JMSProducer and JMSConsumer objects).

The two APIs are intended to offer similar functionality. The classic
API is not deprecated and will remain part of Jakarta Messaging indefinitely.

Section 15 “Examples of the simplified API” contains a number of
examples which compare the use of the simplified and classic APIs in a
number of simple Jakarta EE and Java SE use cases.

==== New method to extract the body directly from a Message (JMS_SPEC-101)

Two new methods have been added to Message:

* <T> T getBody(Class<T> c)
* boolean isBodyAssignableTo(Class c)
+
The getBody method returns the message body as an object of the
specified type. This provides a convenient way to obtain the body from a
newly-received Message object. It can be used either
* to return the body of a TextMessage, MapMessage or BytesMessage as a
String, Map or byte[] without the need to cast the Message first to the
appropriate subtype, or
* to return the body of an ObjectMessage without the need to cast the
Message to ObjectMessage, extract the body as a Serializable, and cast
it to the specified type.
+
The isBodyAssignableTo method is a companion method which can be used to
determine whether a subsequent call to getBody would be able to return
the body of a particular Message object as a particular type.
+
The example in section 14.2.3 “Unpacking a TextMessage” has been updated
to demonstrate the use of the getBody method.

==== Subscription name characters and length

Jakarta Messaging 1.1 did not define what characters were valid in a durable
subscription name, or what length of name was supported.

Jakarta Messaging 2.0 defines a minimum set of characters that must be valid in a
durable or non-durable subscription name. It also defines that
subscription names of up to 128 characters long must be supported.

For details see section 4.2.4 “Subscription name characters and length”

==== Clarification: message may be sent using any session (JMS_SPEC-52)

The specification and javadocs have been clarified to make it clear that
a message may be sent using any session, not just the session used to
create the message.

Section 6.2.4 “Optimized message implementations” has been updated
accordingly.

==== Clarification: use of ExceptionListener (JMS_SPEC-49)

Section 6.1.7 “ExceptionListener” has been amended to clarify how an
ExceptionListener is used:

* The existing text which states that a connection “serializes execution
of its ExceptionListener” has been extended to explain what this means.
* A note has been added to state that there are no restrictions on the
use of the Jakarta Messaging API by the listener’s onException method.

In addition, the following changes to javadoc comments have been made:

* The javadoc comments for the stop and close methods on the Connection
interface have been amended to clarify that, if an exception listener
for the connection is running when stop or close are invoked, there is
no requirement for the stop or close call to wait until the exception
listener has returned before it may return.
* Similarly, the javadoc comment for the close method on the Session
interface has been amended to clarify that, if an exception listener for
the session’s connection is running when close is invoked, there is no
requirement for the close call to wait until the exception listener has
returned before it may return.
* The javadoc comments for the stop and close methods on the JMSContext
interface have been amended to clarify that, if an exception listener
for the JMSContext’s connection is running when stop or close are
invoked, there is no requirement for the stop or close call to wait
until the exception listener has returned before it may return.

==== Clarification: use of stop or close from a message listener (JMS_SPEC-48)

The specification has been clarified to clarify the required behaviour
if various stop or close methods are called from within the onMessage
method of a MessageListener.

The Jakarta Messaging 1.1 specification states that the stop method on Connection and
the close methods on Connection, Session and MessageConsumer must not
return until any message listeners have returned. This means that if
these methods are called from a message listener on its own Connection,
Session or MessageConsumer then deadlock would occur.

The Jakarta Messaging 2.0 specification amends the required behaviour to avoid the
possibility of deadlock.

If a MessageListener’s onMessage method calls stop or close on its own
Connection, close on its own Session, stop or close on its own
JMSContext, or stop on a JMSContext which uses the same connection, then
the stop or close method will either fail and throw a
jakarta.jms.IllegalStateException (for methods on Session and Connection)
or jakarta.jms.IllegalStateRuntimeException (for methods on JMSContext),
or it will succeed and stop or close the Connection, Session or
JMSContext as appropriate.

However a different approach has been taken for the close methods on
MessageConsumer and JMSConsumer. A MessageListener’s onMessage method is
explicitly allowed to call close on its own MessageConsumer or
JMSConsumer.

For details see the following sections:

* Section 6.1.5 “Pausing delivery of incoming messages”
* Section 6.1.8 “Closing a connection”
* Section 6.2.15 “Closing a session”
* Section 8.8 “Closing a consumer”.

The Jakarta Messaging 1.1 specification states that the close methods on Connection or
Session are exempt from the requirement that the resources of a session
may only be used by one thread at a time.

In Jakarta Messaging 2.0 this exemption also applies to the close method on
JMSContext, and has been extended to cover the close methods on a
MessageConsumer or JMSConsumer.

For details see the following sections:

* Section 6.2.5 “Threading restrictions on a session”
* Section 6.2.6 “Threading restrictions on a JMSContext”

==== Clarification: use of noLocal when creating a durable subscription (JMS_SPEC-65)

The specification has been amended to clarify the effect of setting the
noLocal argument when creating a durable subscription. This was poorly
defined in Jakarta Messaging 1.1.

The new definition of noLocal is given in section 8.3.3 “Unshared
durable subscriptions”. This states that when a durable subscription is
created on a topic, the noLocal argument may be used to specify that
messages published to the topic by its own connection or any other with
the same client identifier will not be added to the durable
subscription. It also states that if the client identifier is unset then
setting noLocal to true will cause an exception to be thrown.

==== Clarification: message headers that are intended to be set by the Jakarta Messaging provider (JMS_SPEC-34)

The specification has been clarified to state that the following methods
on Message are not for use by client applications and setting them does
not have any effect:

setJMSDeliveryMode, setJMSExpiration, setJMSPriority, setJMSMessageID,
setJMSTimestamp, setJMSRedelivered, setJMSDeliveryTime (new header
property: see section A.1.9).

Section 3.4.11 “How message header values are set” has been extended to
explain this.

==== Clarification: Session methods createQueue and createTopic (JMS_SPEC-31)

The javadoc comments for the createQueue and createTopic methods on
Session and JMSContext have been reworded to clarify that these methods
simply create a Queue or Topic object which encapsulates the name of the
queue or topic and do not create the physical queue or topic in the Jakarta Messaging
provider.

In addition a note has been added to these javadoc comments to explain
that although creating a physical queue or topic is provider-specific
and is typically an administrative task performed by an administrator,
some providers may create them automatically when needed.

==== Clarification: Definition of JMSExpiration (JMS_SPEC-82)

In the Jakarta Messaging 1.1 specification, section 3.4.9 “JMSExpiration”, a message’s
expiration time was defined as “the sum of the time-to-live value
specified on the send method and the current GMT value”.

However the JMSExpiration header field is a long value and the
specification does not define how the expiration time is converted to a
long.

This has now been clarified to state that it is “the difference,
measured in milliseconds, between the expiration time and midnight,
January 1, 1970 UTC.” This definition is chosen to be consistent with
the java.lang.System method currentTimeMillis.

The updated text can be seen in section 3.4.9 “JMSExpiration” and
section 7.8 “Message time-to-live”.

==== Correction: Reconnecting to a durable subscription (JMS_SPEC-80)

In the Jakarta Messaging 1.1 specification, section 9.3.3.2 “Reconnect to a topic
using a durable subscription” stated that “the client must be attached
to the same Connection”. This was incorrect and has now been corrected
to state that the client must use a connection with the same client
identifier.

In addition this section has been renamed 14.3.3.2 “Creating a consumer
on an existing durable subscription” and rewritten to make it clearer.

==== Correction: MapMessage when name is null (JMS_SPEC-77)

In the Jakarta Messaging 1.1 API documentation for jakarta.jms.MapMessage, the method
setBytes (String name, byte[] value) is defined as throwing a
NullPointerException “if the name is null, or if the name is an empty
string.”

However there are eleven other methods on MapMessage of the form
setSomething(name,value). These all specify that a
IllegalArgumentException is thrown “if the name is null or if the name
is an empty string.”

This appears to be an error in the API documentation. This is confirmed
by the Jakarta Messaging compliance tests which already expect setBytes to throw a
IllegalArgumentException.

The API documentation for setBytes has therefore been changed to match
the other methods and specify that an IllegalArgumentException should be
thrown in this case.
